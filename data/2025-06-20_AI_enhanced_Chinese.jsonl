The dataset includes 14 clinically significant AEs-such as falls, delirium, and intracranial haemorrhage, along with contextual attributes like negation, diagnosis type, and in-hospital occurrence. Uniquely, the annotation schema supports both discontinuous and overlapping entities, addressing challenges rarely tackled in prior work. We evaluate multiple models using FlairNLP across three annotation granularities: fine-grained, coarse-grained, and coarse-grained with negation. While transformer-based models (e.g., BERT-cased) achieve strong performance on document-level coarse-grained extraction (F1 = 0.943), performance drops notably for fine-grained entity-level tasks (e.g., F1 = 0.675), particularly for rare events and complex attributes. These results demonstrate that despite high-level scores, significant challenges remain in detecting underrepresented AEs and capturing nuanced clinical language.

During training, these approaches do not require the model to be aware of the constraints, which are merely implicit in the training outputs $y$. This is advantageous as it allows for dynamic constraints without requiring retraining, but can lead to low-quality output during constrained decoding at test time. We overcome this problem with Boosted Constrained Decoding (BoostCD), which combines constrained and unconstrained decoding in two phases: Phase 1 decodes from the base model $M$ twice, in constrained and unconstrained mode, obtaining two weak predictions. In phase 2, a learned autoregressive boosted model combines the two weak predictions into one final prediction. The mistakes made by the base model with vs. without constraints tend to be complementary, which the boosted model learns to exploit for improved performance. We demonstrate the power of BoostCD by applying it to closed information extraction.

However, existing methods often overlook a critical challenge: the credibility of context documents can vary widely, potentially leading to the propagation of unreliable information. In this paper, we introduce CrEst, a novel weakly supervised framework for assessing the credibility of context documents during LLM inference--without requiring manual annotations. Our approach is grounded in the insight that credible documents tend to exhibit higher semantic coherence with other credible documents, enabling automated credibility estimation through inter-document agreement. To incorporate credibility into LLM inference, we propose two integration strategies: a black-box approach for models without access to internal weights or activations, and a white-box method that directly modifies attention mechanisms. Extensive experiments across three model architectures and five datasets demonstrate that CrEst consistently outperforms strong baselines, achieving up to a 26.86% improvement in accuracy and a 3.49% increase in F1 score.

New evaluation benchmarks are of increasing priority as the reasoning capabilities of LLMs are expanding at a rapid pace. In particular, while multi-document (MD) reasoning is an area of extreme relevance given LLM capabilities in handling longer-context inputs, few benchmarks exist to rigorously examine model behavior in this setting. Moreover, the multi-document setting is historically challenging for benchmark creation due to the expensive cost of annotating long inputs. In this work, we introduce MDBench, a new dataset for evaluating LLMs on the task of multi-document reasoning. Notably, MDBench is created through a novel synthetic generation process, allowing us to controllably and efficiently generate challenging document sets and the corresponding question-answer (QA) examples. Our novel technique operates on condensed structured seed knowledge, modifying it through LLM-assisted edits to induce MD-specific reasoning challenges. We then convert this structured knowledge into a natural text surface form, generating a document set and corresponding QA example. We analyze the behavior of popular LLMs and prompting techniques, finding that MDBENCH poses significant challenges for all methods, even with relatively short document sets.

In CALM, symbolic predicates evaluate to analog truth values computed by neural networks and constrained search.\n  Methods: CALM represents each predicate using a domain tree, which iteratively refines its analog truth value when the contextual groundings of its entities are determined. The iterative refinement is predicted by neural networks capable of capturing multi-modal information and is filtered through a symbolic reasoning module to ensure constraint satisfaction.\n  Results: In fill-in-the-blank object placement tasks, CALM achieved 92.2% accuracy, outperforming classical logic (86.3%) and LLM (59.4%) baselines. It also demonstrated spatial heatmap generation aligned with logical constraints and delicate human preferences, as shown by a human study.\n  Conclusions: CALM demonstrates the potential to reason with logic structure while aligning with preferences in multi-modal environments. It lays the foundation for next-gen AI systems that require the precision and interpretation of logic and the multimodal information processing of neural networks.", "AI": {"tldr": "CALM\u7ed3\u5408\u7b26\u53f7\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u654f\u611f\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u903b\u8f91\u4e0e\u611f\u77e5\u95f4\u7684\u9e3f\u6c9f\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u903b\u8f91\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u4e8c\u503c\u903b\u8f91\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u4eba\u7c7b\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u7ec6\u5fae\u5dee\u522b\uff0c\u800c\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u7ed3\u6784\u3002CALM\u65e8\u5728\u6574\u5408\u4e24\u8005\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "CALM\u4f7f\u7528\u57df\u6811\u8868\u793a\u8c13\u8bcd\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\u5176\u6a21\u62df\u771f\u503c\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u7b26\u53f7\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u5757\u4e2d\u8fc7\u6ee4\u4ee5\u6ee1\u8db3\u7ea6\u675f\u6761\u4ef6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u586b\u7a7a\u5f0f\u7269\u4f53\u653e\u7f6e\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cCALM\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe92.2%\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u903b\u8f91\uff0886.3%\uff09\u548cLLM\uff0859.4%\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u751f\u6210\u7b26\u5408\u903b\u8f91\u7ea6\u675f\u548c\u4eba\u7c7b\u504f\u597d\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u70ed\u56fe\u3002", "conclusion": "CALM\u4e3a\u9700\u8981\u903b\u8f91\u7cbe\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5904\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "keywords": "CALM, \u591a\u6a21\u6001, \u7b26\u53f7\u63a8\u7406, \u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc, \u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u654f\u611f"}}

We conduct an empirical analysis using the Pima Indian Diabetes Database (PIDD). We evaluate six LLMs, including four open-source models: Gemma-2-27B, Mistral-7B, Llama-3.1-8B, and Llama-3.2-2B. We also test two proprietary models: GPT-4o and Gemini Flash 2.0. In addition, we compare their performance with three traditional machine learning models: Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machine (SVM). We use accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score as evaluation metrics. Our results show that proprietary LLMs perform better than open-source ones, with GPT-4o and Gemma-2-27B achieving the highest accuracy in few-shot settings. Notably, Gemma-2-27B also outperforms the traditional ML models in terms of F1-score.

While the Ising model can in principle encode arbitrary optimization problems, practical implementations are often hindered by soft constraints that either slow down mixing when too strong, or fail to enforce feasibility when too weak. We introduce a two-dimensional extension of the powerful parallel tempering algorithm (PT) that addresses this challenge by adding a second dimension of replicas interpolating the penalty strengths. This scheme ensures constraint satisfaction in the final replicas, analogous to low-energy states at low temperature. The resulting two-dimensional parallel tempering algorithm (2D-PT) improves mixing in heavily constrained replicas and eliminates the need to explicitly tune the penalty strength. In a representative example of graph sparsification with copy constraints, 2D-PT achieves near-ideal mixing, with Kullback-Leibler divergence decaying as O(1/t). When applied to sparsified Wishart instances, 2D-PT yields orders of magnitude speedup over conventional PT with the same number of replicas. The method applies broadly to constrained Ising problems and can be deployed on existing Ising machines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a2D-PT\u7684\u5e76\u884c\u9000\u706b\u7b97\u6cd5\u6269\u5c55\u7248\u672c\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u7b2c\u4e8c\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7684\u590d\u672c\u63d2\u503c\u60e9\u7f5a\u5f3a\u5ea6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u5e76\u884c\u9000\u706b\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u6df7\u5408\u7ea6\u675f\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u52a8\u673a\u5728\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u5e76\u884c\u9000\u706b\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u7ea6\u675f\u95ee\u9898\u65f6\u6027\u80fd\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u6df7\u5408\u7ea6\u675f\u96be\u4ee5\u5e73\u8861\u548c\u8c03\u4f18\u60e9\u7f5a\u5f3a\u5ea6\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u3002", "method": "\u65b9\u6cd5\u662f\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u4e8c\u7ef4\u590d\u672c\u63d2\u503c\u60e9\u7f5a\u5f3a\u5ea6\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u7ea6\u675f\u6ee1\u8db3\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u6df7\u5408\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u663e\u5f0f\u8c03\u4f18\u60e9\u7f5a\u5f3a\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56fe\u5f62\u7a00\u758f\u5316\u548cWishart\u5b9e\u4f8b\u4e2d\uff0c2D-PT\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8fd1\u4e4e\u7406\u60f3\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u5e76\u884c\u9000\u706b\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u8bba\u662f2D-PT\u7b97\u6cd5\u53ef\u4ee5\u5e7f\u6cdb\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u7ea6\u675fIsing\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u53ef\u76f4\u63a5\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7684Ising\u673a\u5668\u3002", "keywords": "Boltzmann\u6982\u7387\u5206\u5e03, Ising\u673a\u5668, \u5e76\u884c\u9000\u706b\u7b97\u6cd5, \u7ea6\u675f\u4f18\u5316"}}

This is achieved by introducing a special memory token, whose embedding is optimized through training on a fixed sequence. When prompted with this embedding, the model reconstructs the fixed sequence exactly. We evaluate this phenomenon across English and Spanish datasets, sequences of up to approximately 240 tokens, and model scales ranging from 100M to 8B parameters.

As a crucial component for developing these reasoning models, reinforcement learning (RL), exemplified by Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and its variants, allows models to learn through trial and error. However, PPO can be time-consuming due to its inherent on-policy nature, which is further exacerbated by increasing response lengths. In this work, we propose Truncated Proximal Policy Optimization (T-PPO), a novel extension to PPO that improves training efficiency by streamlining policy update and length-restricted response generation. T-PPO mitigates the issue of low hardware utilization, an inherent drawback of fully synchronized long-generation procedures, where resources often sit idle during the waiting periods for complete rollouts. Our contributions are two-folds. First, we propose Extended Generalized Advantage Estimation (EGAE) for advantage estimation derived from incomplete responses while maintaining the integrity of policy learning. Second, we devise a computationally optimized mechanism that allows for the independent optimization of the policy and value models. By selectively filtering prompt and truncated tokens, this mechanism reduces redundant computations and accelerates the training process without sacrificing convergence performance. We demonstrate the effectiveness and efficacy of T-PPO on AIME 2024 with a 32B base model. The experimental results show that T-PPO improves the training efficiency of reasoning LLMs by up to 2.5x and outperforms its existing competitors.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aT-PPO\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u66f4\u65b0\u548c\u751f\u6210\u54cd\u5e94\u957f\u5ea6\u7684\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8ePPO\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u751f\u6210\u957f\u54cd\u5e94\u65f6\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u4e14\u786c\u4ef6\u5229\u7528\u7387\u4f4e\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u4f18\u5316\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86T-PPO\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u62ecEGAE\u4f18\u52bf\u4f30\u8ba1\u548c\u72ec\u7acb\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u4e0e\u4ef7\u503c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u5728AIME 2024\u4e0a\u6d4b\u8bd5\u663e\u793a\uff0cT-PPO\u5c06\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e862.5\u500d\uff0c\u4e14\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "T-PPO\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u8bad\u7ec3\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u786c\u4ef6\u5229\u7528\u7387\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u3002", "keywords": "T-PPO,LLMs,\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1,\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60,\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387"}}

We formalize NetraAI's foundations, combining contraction mappings, information geometry, and evolutionary algorithms to identify predictive patient cohorts.

A pseudo-temporal embedding and long-range memory enable exploration of higher-order feature interactions, while an internal evolutionary loop selects compact, explainable 2-4-variable bundles (\"Personas\").\n  To guide discovery, we introduce an LLM Strategist as a meta-evolutionary layer that observes Persona outputs, prioritizes promising variables, injects domain knowledge, and assesses robustness. This two-tier architecture mirrors the human scientific process: NetraAI as experimentalist, the LLM as theorist, forming a self-improving loop.\n  In case studies (schizophrenia, depression, pancreatic cancer), NetraAI uncovered small, high-effect-size subpopulations that transformed weak baseline models (AUC ~0.50-0.68) into near-perfect classifiers using only a few features.

We introduce \\textbf{HeurAgenix}, a two-stage hyper-heuristic framework powered by large language models (LLMs) that first evolves heuristics and then selects among them automatically. In the heuristic evolution phase, HeurAgenix leverages an LLM to compare seed heuristic solutions with higher-quality solutions and extract reusable evolution strategies. During problem solving, it dynamically picks the most promising heuristic for each problem state, guided by the LLM's perception ability. For flexibility, this selector can be either a state-of-the-art LLM or a fine-tuned lightweight model with lower inference cost. To mitigate the scarcity of reliable supervision caused by CO complexity, we fine-tune the lightweight heuristic selector with a dual-reward mechanism that jointly exploits singals from selection preferences and state perception, enabling robust selection under noisy annotations. Extensive experiments on canonical benchmarks show that HeurAgenix not only outperforms existing LLM-based hyper-heuristics but also matches or exceeds specialized solvers.

Existing methods often miss key aspects like coherence, style, or relevance, or are biased by pretraining data, making open-ended long-form evaluation an underexplored problem. To address this gap, we propose PrefBERT, a scoring model for evaluating open-ended long-form generation in GRPO and guiding its training with distinct rewards for good and bad outputs. Trained on two response evaluation datasets with diverse long-form styles and Likert-rated quality, PrefBERT effectively supports GRPO by offering better semantic reward feedback than traditional metrics ROUGE-L and BERTScore do. Through comprehensive evaluations, including LLM-as-a-judge, human ratings, and qualitative analysis, we show that PrefBERT, trained on multi-sentence and paragraph-length responses, remains reliable across varied long passages and aligns well with the verifiable rewards GRPO needs.

However, autonomous coordination in multi-satellite systems remains a fundamental challenge. Traditional optimisation approaches struggle to handle the real-time decision-making demands of dynamic EO missions, necessitating the use of Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL). In this paper, we investigate RL-based autonomous EO mission planning by modelling single-satellite operations and extending to multi-satellite constellations using MARL frameworks. We address key challenges, including energy and data storage limitations, uncertainties in satellite observations, and the complexities of decentralised coordination under partial observability. By leveraging a near-realistic satellite simulation environment, we evaluate the training stability and performance of state-of-the-art MARL algorithms, including PPO, IPPO, MAPPO, and HAPPO.

These parameters have traditionally been predicted via direct measurements which might lead to challenges in case of sensor faults. Alternatively, a data-driven prediction model based on surface pressure data can be used to determine these parameters. It is essential that such predictors achieve close to real-time learning as dictated by practical applications such as monitoring wind tunnel operations or learning the variations in aerodynamic performance of aerospace and wind energy systems. To overcome the challenges caused by changes in the data distribution as well as in adapting to a new prediction task, we propose a transfer learning methodology to predict the onflow parameters, specifically angle of attack and onflow speed. It requires first training a convolutional neural network (ConvNet) model offline for the core prediction task, then freezing the weights of this model except the selected layers preceding the output node, and finally executing transfer learning by retraining these layers. A demonstration of this approach is provided using steady CFD analysis data for an airfoil for i) domain adaptation where transfer learning is performed with data from a target domain having different data distribution than the source domain and ii) task adaptation where the prediction task is changed. Further exploration on the influence of noisy data, performance on an extended domain, and trade studies varying sampling sizes and architectures are provided.

In this paper, we focus on the maritime computation offloading and resource allocation through the cooperation of UAVs and vessels, with consideration of uncertain tasks. Specifically, we propose a cooperative MEC framework for computation offloading and resource allocation, including MIoT devices, UAVs and vessels.

Further, considering the heterogeneity of actions and resources of UAVs and vessels, we reformulate the small-scale optimization problem into a Markov game (MG).

However, existing multimodal approaches primarily focus on utilizing text data to help time series forecasting, leaving the visual data in existing time series datasets untouched. Furthermore, it is challenging for models to effectively capture the physical information embedded in visual data, such as satellite imagery's temporal and geospatial context, which extends beyond images themselves. To address this gap, we propose physics-informed positional encoding (PIPE), a lightweight method that embeds physical information into vision language models (VLMs). PIPE introduces two key innovations: (1) a physics-informed positional indexing scheme for mapping physics to positional IDs, and (2) a variant-frequency positional encoding mechanism for encoding frequency information of physical variables and sequential order of tokens within the embedding space.

However, linguistic features in dialogues, such as omission and idiom, frequently introduce ambiguities that obscure the intended discourse relations, posing significant challenges for parsers. To address this issue, we propose a Discourse-aware Clarification Module (DCM) to enhance the performance of the dialogue discourse parser. DCM employs two distinct reasoning processes: clarification type reasoning and discourse goal reasoning. The former analyzes linguistic features, while the latter distinguishes the intended relation from the ambiguous one. Furthermore, we introduce Contribution-aware Preference Optimization (CPO) to mitigate the risk of erroneous clarifications, thereby reducing cascading errors. CPO enables the parser to assess the contributions of the clarifications from DCM and provide feedback to optimize the DCM, enhancing its adaptability and alignment with the parser's requirements.

We address this by examining the unique characteristics of Navigation tasks through the lens of causality, introducing a causal framework to highlight the limitations of conventional sequential methods. Leveraging this insight, we propose Causality-Aware Navigation (CAN), which incorporates a Causal Understanding Module to enhance the agent's environmental understanding capability.

Multi-deep autonomous vehicle storage and retrieval systems (AVS/RS) present a viable solution for achieving greater storage density. However, these systems encounter significant challenges during retrieval operations due to lane blockages. A conventional approach to mitigate this issue involves storing items with homogeneous characteristics in a single lane, but this strategy restricts the flexibility and adaptability of multi-deep storage systems.\n  In this study, we propose a deep reinforcement learning-based framework to address the retrieval problem in multi-deep storage systems with heterogeneous item configurations. Each item is associated with a specific due date, and the objective is to minimize total tardiness. To effectively capture the system's topology, we introduce a graph-based state representation that integrates both item attributes and the local topological structure of the multi-deep warehouse. To process this representation, we design a novel neural network architecture that combines a Graph Neural Network (GNN) with a Transformer model. The GNN encodes topological and item-specific information into embeddings for all directly accessible items, while the Transformer maps these embeddings into global priority assignments. The Transformer's strong generalization capability further allows our approach to be applied to storage systems with diverse layouts.

However, existing large language models face two major challenges: insufficient representation of medical knowledge and low efficiency in clinical deployment. To address these challenges, this study proposes the CKD-EHR (Clinical Knowledge Distillation for EHR) framework, which achieves efficient and accurate disease risk prediction through knowledge distillation techniques. Specifically, the large language model Qwen2.5-7B is first fine-tuned on medical knowledge-enhanced data to serve as the teacher model.It then generates interpretable soft labels through a multi-granularity attention distillation mechanism. Finally, the distilled knowledge is transferred to a lightweight BERT student model. Experimental results show that on the MIMIC-III dataset, CKD-EHR significantly outperforms the baseline model:diagnostic accuracy is increased by 9%, F1-score is improved by 27%, and a 22.2 times inference speedup is achieved. This innovative solution not only greatly improves resource utilization efficiency but also significantly enhances the accuracy and timeliness of diagnosis, providing a practical technical approach for resource optimization in clinical settings.

The LPA integrates LLMs with advanced planning capabilities and external tool utilization, enabling autonomous processing of complex queries, retrieval of relevant data from external systems, and generation of human-readable responses. Evaluation results demonstrate the agent's operational effectiveness and reliability in supporting FA tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u7684\u89c4\u5212\u4ee3\u7406\uff08LPA\uff09\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e0e\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8f85\u52a9\u6545\u969c\u5206\u6790\uff08FA\uff09\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e08\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u64cd\u4f5c\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u6545\u969c\u5206\u6790\uff08FA\uff09\u8fc7\u7a0b\u590d\u6742\u4e14\u77e5\u8bc6\u5bc6\u96c6\uff0cAI\u7ec4\u4ef6\u7684\u96c6\u6210\u53ef\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u591a\u79cd\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u4f46\u7ba1\u7406\u591a\u4e2aAI\u6a21\u578b\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u6574\u5408\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6548\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u662f\u4e00\u5927\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e0e\u5b9e\u73b0\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u89c4\u5212\u4ee3\u7406\uff08LPA\uff09\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u9ad8\u7ea7\u89c4\u5212\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u5916\u90e8\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u81ea\u4e3b\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u67e5\u8be2\u3001\u68c0\u7d22\u5916\u90e8\u6570\u636e\u5e76\u751f\u6210\u4eba\u7c7b\u53ef\u8bfb\u7684\u54cd\u5e94\u3002", "result": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u8868\u660eLPA\u5728\u652f\u6301FA\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u64cd\u4f5c\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "LLM-based Planning Agent\uff08LPA\uff09\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u8f85\u52a9FA\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e08\u5b8c\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u5206\u6790\u6548\u7387\u3002", "keywords": "\u6545\u969c\u5206\u6790, AI\u96c6\u6210, \u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b, \u89c4\u5212\u4ee3\u7406, \u81ea\u52a8\u5316"}}

Despite prior research showing that modeling this property boosts response diversity, most modern LLM-based dialogue agents do not explicitly do so. In this work, we model the o2m property of OD in LLMs by decomposing OD generation into two key tasks: Multi-Response Generation (MRG) and Preference-based Selection (PS), which entail generating a set of n semantically and lexically diverse high-quality responses for a given dialogue context, followed by selecting a single response based on human preference, respectively. To facilitate MRG and PS, we introduce o2mDial, a dialogue corpus explicitly designed to capture the o2m property by featuring multiple plausible responses for each context. Leveraging o2mDial, we propose new in-context learning and instruction-tuning strategies, as well as novel evaluation metrics for MRG, alongside a model-based approach for PS.

We present a unifying framework for systematically constructing natural language \"state\" representations for prompting LLM agents in repeated multi-agent games. Previous work on games with LLM agents has taken an ad hoc approach to encoding game history, which not only obscures the impact of state representation on agents' behavior, but also limits comparability between studies. Our framework addresses these gaps by characterizing methods of state representation along three axes: action informativeness (i.e., the extent to which the state representation captures actions played); reward informativeness (i.e., the extent to which the state representation describes rewards obtained); and prompting style (or natural language compression, i.e., the extent to which the full text history is summarized).\n  We apply this framework to a dynamic selfish routing game, chosen because it admits a simple equilibrium both in theory and in human subject experiments \\cite{rapoport_choice_2009}. Despite the game's relative simplicity, we find that there are key dependencies of LLM agent behavior on the natural language state representation. In particular, we observe that representations which provide agents with (1) summarized, rather than complete, natural language representations of past history; (2) information about regrets, rather than raw payoffs; and (3) limited information about others' actions lead to behavior that more closely matches game theoretic equilibrium predictions, and with more stable game play by the agents.

As time progresses, concept drift occurs and previously encountered concepts are forgotten, thereby leading to a decline in the accuracy of online predictions. Existing solutions employ parameter updating techniques to delay forgetting; however, this may result in the loss of some previously learned knowledge while neglecting the exploration of knowledge retention mechanisms. To retain all conceptual knowledge and fully utilize it when the concepts recur, we propose the Continuous Evolution Pool (CEP), a pooling mechanism that stores different instances of forecasters for different concepts. Our method first selects the forecaster nearest to the test sample and then learns the features from its neighboring samples - a process we refer to as the retrieval. If there are insufficient neighboring samples, it indicates that a new concept has emerged, and a new model will evolve from the current nearest sample to the pool to store the knowledge of the concept.

These techniques increase the average token length, thus lowering fertility while preserving linguistic information.

However, the prevailing post-secondary computing curriculum is currently ill-equipped to prepare future AI practitioners to confront increasing demands to implement abstract ethical principles and normative policy preferences into the design and development of AI systems. We believe that familiarity with the 'AI policy landscape' and the ability to translate ethical principles to practices will in the future constitute an important responsibility for even the most technically-focused AI engineers.\n  Toward preparing current computer science (CS) students for these new expectations, we developed an AI Policy Module to introduce discussions of AI policy into the CS curriculum. Building on a successful pilot in fall 2024, in this innovative practice full paper we present an updated and expanded version of the module, including a technical assignment on \"AI regulation\". We present the findings from our pilot of the AI Policy Module 2.0, evaluating student attitudes towards AI ethics and policy through pre- and post-module surveys. Following the module, students reported increased concern about the ethical impacts of AI technologies while also expressing greater confidence in their abilities to engage in discussions about AI regulation.

Applying structured recall tasks to the Mamba architecture, we observe a consistent U-shaped accuracy profile, indicating strong performance at the beginning and end of input sequences. We identify three mechanisms that give rise to this pattern. First, long-term memory is supported by a sparse subset of channels within the model's selective state space block, which persistently encode early input tokens and are causally linked to primacy effects. Second, short-term memory is governed by delta-modulated recurrence: recent inputs receive more weight due to exponential decay, but this recency advantage collapses when distractor items are introduced, revealing a clear limit to memory depth. Third, we find that memory allocation is dynamically modulated by semantic regularity: repeated relations in the input sequence shift the delta gating behavior, increasing the tendency to forget intermediate items.

In this work, we explore the representational and behavioral origins of this inefficiency, revealing that LRMs inherently possess the capacity for more concise reasoning. Empirical analyses show that correct reasoning paths vary significantly in length, and the shortest correct responses often suffice, indicating untapped efficiency potential. Exploiting these findings, we propose two lightweight methods to enhance LRM efficiency.

Second, we develop Self-Rewarded Efficiency RL, a reinforcement learning framework that dynamically balances task accuracy and brevity by rewarding concise correct solutions.

To enable efficient search over system-level structures, SwarmAgentic maintains a population of candidate systems and evolves them via feedback-guided updates, drawing inspiration from Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO).

Given only a task description and an objective function, SwarmAgentic outperforms all baselines, achieving a +261.8% relative improvement over ADAS on the TravelPlanner benchmark, highlighting the effectiveness of full automation in structurally unconstrained tasks. This framework marks a significant step toward scalable and autonomous agentic system design, bridging swarm intelligence with fully automated system multi-agent generation.

We expose a fundamental limit on this tradeoff. For any model whose representational similarity between inputs decays with finite semantic resolution $\\varepsilon$, we derive closed-form expressions that pin its probability of correct generalization $p_S$ and identification $p_I$ to a universal Pareto front independent of input space geometry. Extending the analysis to noisy, heterogeneous spaces and to $n>2$ inputs predicts a sharp $1/n$ collapse of multi-input processing capacity and a non-monotonic optimum for $p_S$. A minimal ReLU network trained end-to-end reproduces these laws: during learning a resolution boundary self-organizes and empirical $(p_S,p_I)$ trajectories closely follow theoretical curves for linearly decaying similarity. Finally, we demonstrate that the same limits persist in two markedly more complex settings -- a convolutional neural network and state-of-the-art vision-language models -- confirming that finite-resolution similarity is a fundamental emergent informational constraint, not merely a toy-model artifact.

However, the underlying mechanisms supporting such transfer remain poorly understood. We hypothesize that cross-domain generalization arises from shared abstract reasoning prototypes -- fundamental reasoning patterns that capture the essence of problems across domains. These prototypes minimize the nuances of the representation, revealing that seemingly diverse tasks are grounded in shared reasoning structures.Based on this hypothesis, we propose ProtoReasoning, a framework that enhances the reasoning ability of LLMs by leveraging scalable and verifiable prototypical representations (Prolog for logical reasoning, PDDL for planning).ProtoReasoning features: (1) an automated prototype construction pipeline that transforms problems into corresponding prototype representations; (2) a comprehensive verification system providing reliable feedback through Prolog/PDDL interpreters; (3) the scalability to synthesize problems arbitrarily within prototype space while ensuring correctness. Extensive experiments show that ProtoReasoning achieves 4.7% improvement over baseline models on logical reasoning (Enigmata-Eval), 6.3% improvement on planning tasks, 4.0% improvement on general reasoning (MMLU) and 1.0% on mathematics (AIME24).

Compared to closed-ended QA, it demands longer answer statements, more nuanced reasoning processes, and diverse expressions, making refined and interpretable automatic evaluation both crucial and challenging. Traditional metrics like ROUGE and BERTScore struggle to capture semantic similarities due to different patterns between model responses and reference answers. Current LLM-based evaluation approaches, such as pairwise or listwise comparisons of candidate answers, lack intuitive interpretability. While pointwise scoring of each response provides some descriptions, it fails to adapt across different question contents. Most notably, existing methods overlook the distinction between factoid and non-factoid questions. To address these challenges, we propose \\textbf{MinosEval}, a novel evaluation method that first distinguishes open-ended questions and then ranks candidate answers using different evaluation strategies. For factoid questions, it applies an adaptive key-point scoring strategy, while for non-factoid questions, it uses an instance-aware listwise ranking strategy.

Investigating continuous differential equations has been a promising approach for studying the discrete optimization methods. Despite the crucial role of momentum in gradient-based optimization methods, the gap between the original discrete dynamics and the continuous time approximations due to the discretization error has not been comprehensively bridged yet. In this work, we study the HB momentum method in continuous time while putting more focus on the discretization error to provide additional theoretical tools to this area. In particular, we design a first-order piece-wise continuous differential equation, where we add a number of counter terms to account for the discretization error explicitly. As a result, we provide a continuous time model for the HB momentum method that allows the control of discretization error to arbitrary order of the step size. As an application, we leverage it to find a new implicit regularization of the directional smoothness and investigate the implicit bias of HB for diagonal linear networks, indicating how our results can be used in deep learning.

Evaluating NLI Performance in Basque and Spanish Geographical Variants", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "comment": null, "summary": "In this paper, we evaluate the capacity of current language technologies to understand Basque and Spanish language varieties. We use Natural Language Inference (NLI) as a pivot task and introduce a novel, manually-curated parallel dataset in Basque and Spanish, along with their respective variants. Our empirical analysis of crosslingual and in-context learning experiments using encoder-only and decoder-based Large Language Models (LLMs) shows a performance drop when handling linguistic variation, especially in Basque. Error analysis suggests that this decline is not due to lexical overlap, but rather to the linguistic variation itself.

VLMs integrate visual modalities with large language models (LLMs), which are well known to be prompt-sensitive. Hence, it is crucial to determine whether VLMs inherit this instability to varying prompts. We therefore investigate which prompt variations VLMs are most sensitive to and which VLMs are most agnostic to prompt variations. To this end, we introduce PARC (Prompt Analysis via Reliability and Calibration), a VLM prompt sensitivity analysis framework built on three pillars: (1) plausible prompt variations in both the language and vision domain, (2) a novel model reliability score with built-in guarantees, and (3) a calibration step that enables dataset- and prompt-spanning prompt variation analysis. Regarding prompt variations, PARC's evaluation shows that VLMs mirror LLM language prompt sensitivity in the vision domain, and most destructive variations change the expected answer. Regarding models, outstandingly robust VLMs among 22 evaluated models come from the InternVL2 family. We further find indications that prompt sensitivity is linked to training data.

Current evaluations of Explainable AI (XAI) often prioritize technical fidelity over cognitive accessibility which critically affects users, in particular those with visual impairments. We propose CUE, a model for Cognitive Understanding of Explanations, linking explanation properties to cognitive sub-processes: legibility (perception), readability (comprehension), and interpretability (interpretation). In a study (N=455) testing heatmaps with varying colormaps (BWR, Cividis, Coolwarm), we found comparable task performance but lower confidence/effort for visually impaired users. Unlike expected, these gaps were not mitigated and sometimes worsened by accessibility-focused color maps like Cividis. These results challenge assumptions about perceptual optimization and support the need for adaptive XAI interfaces.

The field of XAI is rapidly expanding, driven by the growing societal implications of the widespread adoption of AI (and in particular machine learning) across diverse applications. Researchers who study the interaction between humans and XAI techniques typically develop ad hoc interfaces in order to conduct their studies. These interfaces are usually not shared alongside the results of the studies, which limits their reusability and the reproducibility of experiments. In response, we design and implement WebXAII, a web-based platform that can embody full experimental protocols, meaning that it can present all aspects of the experiment to human participants and record their responses. The experimental protocols are translated into a composite architecture of generic views and modules, which offers a lot of flexibility. The architecture is defined in a structured configuration file, so that protocols can be implemented with minimal programming skills.

Currently, researchers rely on Dual-Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA) scans to measure these metrics; however, DXA scans are costly and time-consuming. This work proposes an alternative to DXA scans by applying statistical and machine learning models on biomarkers (height, volume, left calf circumference, etc) obtained from 3D optical images. The dataset consists of 847 patients and was sourced from Pennington Biomedical Research Center. Extracting patients' data in healthcare faces many technical challenges and legal restrictions. However, most supervised machine learning algorithms are inherently data-intensive, requiring a large amount of training data. To overcome these limitations, we implemented a semi-supervised model, the $p$-Laplacian regression model. This paper is the first to demonstrate the application of a $p$-Laplacian model for regression.

We introduce DeVisE (Demographics and Vital signs Evaluation), a behavioral testing framework for probing fine-grained clinical understanding. We construct a dataset of ICU discharge notes from MIMIC-IV, generating both raw (real-world) and template-based (synthetic) versions with controlled single-variable counterfactuals targeting demographic (age, gender, ethnicity) and vital sign attributes. We evaluate five LLMs spanning general-purpose and medically fine-tuned variants, under both zero-shot and fine-tuned settings. We assess model behavior via (1) input-level sensitivity - how counterfactuals alter the likelihood of a note; and (2) downstream reasoning - how they affect predicted hospital length-of-stay. Our results show that zero-shot models exhibit more coherent counterfactual reasoning patterns, while fine-tuned models tend to be more stable yet less responsive to clinically meaningful changes. Notably, demographic factors subtly but consistently influence outputs, emphasizing the importance of fairness-aware evaluation.

Federated Learning (FL) offers a solution by enabling collaborative model training without centralizing data. However, realizing FL for MLLMs presents significant challenges, including high computational demands, limited client capacity, substantial communication costs, and heterogeneous client data. Existing FL methods assume client-side deployment of full models, an assumption that breaks down for large-scale MLLMs due to their massive size and communication demands. To address these limitations, we propose FedNano, the first FL framework that centralizes the LLM on the server while introducing NanoEdge, a lightweight module for client-specific adaptation. NanoEdge employs modality-specific encoders, connectors, and trainable NanoAdapters with low-rank adaptation. This design eliminates the need to deploy LLM on clients, reducing client-side storage by 95%, and limiting communication overhead to only 0.01% of the model parameters.

This helps determine the most effective configurations for natural language generation (NLG) tasks.

However, skepticism persists regarding the practical advantages of QML, mainly due to the current limitations of noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. This study addresses these concerns by extensively assessing Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs)-quantum-inspired counterparts of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), demonstrating their effectiveness compared to classical methods. We systematically construct and evaluate twelve distinct QNN configurations, utilizing two unique quantum feature maps combined with six different entanglement strategies for ansatz design.

A key challenge is achieving robust cross-lingual lexical alignment, crucial for tasks like translation and cross-lingual information retrieval. This paper introduces Targeted Lexical Injection (TLI), a novel and efficient fine-tuning approach. We first demonstrate that Lugha-Llama-8B-wura, a Swahili-centric LLM, exhibits strong, near-perfect lexical alignment for Swahili-English word pairs in its early internal layers (specifically Layer 2, with ~0.99998 average cosine similarity based on a pilot study), a capability not fully reflected in its final output representations (baseline ~0.32 similarity on our evaluation set). TLI leverages this insight by using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and a contrastive learning objective to fine-tune the model, specifically targeting embeddings from this empirically identified optimal early layer. Our experiments show that TLI significantly improves the output-level lexical alignment for 623 trained Swahili-English word pairs, increasing average cosine similarity from 0.3211 to 0.4113 (+28.08%, p < 1.33 x 10^-240). More importantly, these improvements generalize remarkably well to 63 unseen control word pairs, with similarity increasing from 0.3143 to 0.4033 (+28.32%, p < 7.17 x 10^-27). These findings suggest TLI enhances the model's ability to preserve and propagate its inherent early-layer cross-lingual knowledge, offering a parameter-efficient and effective strategy for improving lexical alignment in LRL-focused LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aTLI\u7684\u65b0\u9896\u9ad8\u6548\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u9488\u5bf9\u65e9\u671f\u5c42\u5d4c\u5165\u8fdb\u884c\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\uff08\u5982\u65af\u74e6\u5e0c\u91cc\u8bed\uff09\u4e0e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8bcd\u6c47\u5bf9\u9f50\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u5728\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u8bcd\u6c47\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u7ffb\u8bd1\u548c\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u4fe1\u606f\u68c0\u7d22\u7b49\u4efb\u52a1\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)\u548c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u65e9\u671f\u5c42\uff08\u5982Layer 2\uff09\u7684\u5d4c\u5165\u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u8c03\u3002", "result": "TLI\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u65af\u74e6\u5e0c\u91cc\u8bed-\u82f1\u8bed\u8bcd\u5bf9\u7684\u8bcd\u6c47\u5bf9\u9f50\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u96c6\u548c\u672a\u89c1\u8bcd\u5bf9\u7684\u4f59\u5f26\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u5206\u522b\u63d0\u534728.08%\u548c28.32%\u3002", "conclusion": "TLI\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u6709\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u4e2d\u7684\u8bcd\u6c47\u5bf9\u9f50\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "keywords": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b, \u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00, \u8bcd\u6c47\u5bf9\u9f50, TLI, LoRA"}}

The effectiveness of ML models relies heavily on having large amounts of complete data. However, healthcare data is often limited or incomplete, which can hinder model performance. Additionally, issues like the trustworthiness of solutions vary with the datasets used. The lack of transparency in some ML models further complicates their understanding and use. In healthcare, particularly in the case of Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD), which affects millions of older adults, early diagnosis is crucial due to the absence of effective treatments for reversing progression. Diagnosing AMD involves assessing retinal images along with patients' symptom reports. There is a need for classification approaches that consider genetic, dietary, clinical, and demographic factors. Recently, we introduced the -Comprehensive Abstraction and Classification Tool for Uncovering Structures-(CACTUS), aimed at improving AMD stage classification.

However, current frameworks face critical challenges in system architecture design, cross-domain generalizability, and performance guarantees, particularly as task complexity and number of agents increases. We introduces AgentGroupChat-V2, a novel framework addressing these challenges through three core innovations: (1) a divide-and-conquer fully parallel architecture that decomposes user queries into hierarchical task forest structures enabling dependency management and distributed concurrent processing. (2) an adaptive collaboration engine that dynamically selects heterogeneous LLM combinations and interaction modes based on task characteristics. (3) agent organization optimization strategies combining divide-and-conquer approaches for efficient problem decomposition. Extensive experiments demonstrate AgentGroupChat-V2's superior performance across diverse domains, achieving 91.50% accuracy on GSM8K (exceeding the best baseline by 5.6 percentage points), 30.4% accuracy on competition-level AIME (nearly doubling other methods), and 79.20% pass@1 on HumanEval. Performance advantages become increasingly pronounced with higher task difficulty, particularly on Level 5 MATH problems where improvements exceed 11 percentage points compared to state-of-the-art baselines. These results confirm that AgentGroupChat-V2 provides a comprehensive solution for building efficient, general-purpose LLM multi-agent systems with significant advantages in complex reasoning scenarios.

Directly applying spatial interpolation methods to derive meteorological values at specific locations from low-resolution grid fields often yields results that deviate significantly from the actual conditions. Existing downscaling methods primarily rely on the coupling relationship between geostationary satellites and ERA5 variables as a condition. However, using brightness temperature data from geostationary satellites alone fails to comprehensively capture all the changes in meteorological variables in ERA5 maps. To address this limitation, we can use a wider range of satellite data to make more full use of its inversion effects on various meteorological variables, thus producing more realistic results across different meteorological variables. To further improve the accuracy of downscaling meteorological variables at any location, we propose the Multi-source Observation Down-Scaling Model (MODS). It is a conditional diffusion model that fuses data from multiple geostationary satellites GridSat, polar-orbiting satellites (AMSU-A, HIRS, and MHS), and topographic data (GEBCO), as conditions, and is pre-trained on the ERA5 reanalysis dataset. During training, latent features from diverse conditional inputs are extracted separately and fused into ERA5 maps via a multi-source cross-attention module. By exploiting the inversion relationships between reanalysis data and multi-source atmospheric variables, MODS generates atmospheric states that align more closely with real-world conditions. During sampling, MODS enhances downscaling consistency by incorporating low-resolution ERA5 maps and station-level meteorological data as guidance. Experimental results demonstrate that MODS achieves higher fidelity when downscaling ERA5 maps to a 6.25 km resolution.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u591a\u6e90\u89c2\u6d4b\u964d\u5c3a\u5ea6\u6a21\u578b\uff08MODS\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u878d\u5408\u591a\u6e90\u536b\u661f\u548c\u5730\u5f62\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6c14\u8c61\u53d8\u91cf\u964d\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u964d\u5c3a\u5ea6\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u5355\u9897\u9759\u6b62\u536b\u661f\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5168\u9762\u6355\u6349\u6c14\u8c61\u53d8\u91cf\u7684\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u6570\u636e\u652f\u6301\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u7ed3\u679c\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u3002", "method": "MODS\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6761\u4ef6\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u878d\u5408GridSat\u3001AMSU-A\u3001HIRS\u3001MHS\u7b49\u591a\u6e90\u536b\u661f\u6570\u636e\u548cGEBCO\u5730\u5f62\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6e90\u4ea4\u53c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5757\u63d0\u53d6\u7279\u5f81\u5e76\u878d\u5408\u5230ERA5\u5730\u56fe\u4e2d\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\uff0cMODS\u80fd\u5c06ERA5\u5730\u56fe\u964d\u5c3a\u5ea6\u81f36.25\u516c\u91cc\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u66f4\u63a5\u8fd1\u771f\u5b9e\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "conclusion": "MODS\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6e90\u6570\u636e\u878d\u5408\u548c\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6c14\u8c61\u53d8\u91cf\u964d\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "keywords": "\u964d\u5c3a\u5ea6\u3001\u591a\u6e90\u6570\u636e\u3001\u6c14\u8c61\u53d8\u91cf\u3001\u6761\u4ef6\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u3001ERA5"}}

In real-world scenarios, the clients may not receive data streaming for the disjoint features for the same entity synchronously. Instead, the data are typically generated by an \\emph{event} relevant to only a subset of clients. We are the first to identify these challenges in online VFL, which have been overlooked by previous research. To address these challenges, we proposed an event-driven online VFL framework. In this framework, only a subset of clients were activated during each event, while the remaining clients passively collaborated in the learning process. Furthermore, we incorporated \\emph{dynamic local regret (DLR)} into VFL to address the challenges posed by online learning problems with non-convex models within a non-stationary environment. We conducted a comprehensive regret analysis of our proposed framework, specifically examining the DLR under non-convex conditions with event-driven online VFL. Extensive experiments demonstrated that our proposed framework was more stable than the existing online VFL framework under non-stationary data conditions while also significantly reducing communication and computation costs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4e8b\u4ef6\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u5782\u76f4\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5f02\u6b65\u6570\u636e\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u975e\u51f8\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u5c40\u90e8\u9057\u61be\uff08DLR\uff09\u4f18\u5316\u4e86\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u6210\u672c\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u7ebf\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u5782\u76f4\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u5f3a\uff0c\u4f46\u5f02\u6b65\u6570\u636e\u548c\u975e\u51f8\u6a21\u578b\u5e26\u6765\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u672a\u80fd\u89e3\u51b3\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e8b\u4ef6\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5728\u7ebfVFL\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ec5\u6fc0\u6d3b\u90e8\u5206\u5ba2\u6237\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u52a8\u6001\u5c40\u90e8\u9057\u61be\uff08DLR\uff09\u5904\u7406\u975e\u51f8\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u975e\u7a33\u6001\u6570\u636e\u4e0b\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u901a\u4fe1\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e8b\u4ef6\u9a71\u52a8\u6846\u67b6\u548cDLR\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5728\u7ebfVFL\u4e2d\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "keywords": "\u5782\u76f4\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60, \u5728\u7ebf\u5b66\u4e60, \u4e8b\u4ef6\u9a71\u52a8, \u52a8\u6001\u5c40\u90e8\u9057\u61be"}}

By altering problems in an intermediate symbolic representation, RE-IMAGINE generates arbitrarily many problems that are not solvable using memorization alone. Moreover, the framework is general and can work across reasoning domains, including math, code, and logic. We demonstrate our framework on four widely-used benchmarks to evaluate several families of LLMs, and observe reductions in performance when the models are queried with problem variations.

Past work focused on quantifying representation from audio/video/text using various ML models, but without having the audience in the loop. We ask, even if character distribution along demographic dimensions are available, how useful are they to the general public? Do they actually trust the numbers generated by AI models? Our work addresses these questions through a user study, while proposing a new AI-based character representation and visualization tool. Our tool based on the Contrastive Language Image Pretraining (CLIP) foundation model to analyze visual screen data to quantify character representation across dimensions of age and gender. We also designed effective visualizations suitable for presenting such analytics to lay audience. Next, we conducted a user study to seek empirical evidence on the usefulness and trustworthiness of the AI-generated results for carefully chosen movies presented in the form of our visualizations. We note that participants were able to understand the analytics from our visualization, and deemed the tool `overall useful'. Participants also indicated a need for more detailed visualizations to include more demographic categories and contextual information of the characters.

To address this, we propose Context-INformed Grounding Supervision (CINGS), a post-training supervision in which the model is trained with relevant context prepended to the response, while computing the loss only over the response tokens and masking out the context. Our experiments demonstrate that models trained with CINGS exhibit stronger grounding in both textual and visual domains compared to standard instruction-tuned models. In the text domain, CINGS outperforms other training methods across 11 information-seeking datasets and is complementary to inference-time grounding techniques. In the vision-language domain, replacing a vision-language model's LLM backbone with a CINGS-trained model reduces hallucinations across four benchmarks and maintains factual consistency throughout the generated response. This improved grounding comes without degradation in general downstream performance. Finally, we analyze the mechanism underlying the enhanced grounding in CINGS and find that it induces a shift in the model's prior knowledge and behavior, implicitly encouraging greater reliance on the external context.", "AI": {"tldr": "CINGS \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u76f8\u5173\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u524d\u7f6e\u5e76\u4ec5\u8ba1\u7b97\u54cd\u5e94\u6807\u8bb0\u7684\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5916\u90e8\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e2d\u7684\u751f\u6210\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u7b80\u5355\u9644\u52a0\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u65e0\u6cd5\u4fdd\u8bc1\u751f\u6210\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u786e\u4fdd\u6a21\u578b\u57fa\u4e8e\u5916\u90e8\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7684\u751f\u6210\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528 CINGS \u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u5c06\u76f8\u5173\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u524d\u7f6e\u5230\u54cd\u5e94\u524d\uff0c\u5e76\u4ec5\u8ba1\u7b97\u54cd\u5e94\u6807\u8bb0\u7684\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u5c4f\u853d\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6807\u8bb0\u3002", "result": "CINGS \u5728\u6587\u672c\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u9886\u57df\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u6807\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u5e7b\u89c9\u751f\u6210\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u4e8b\u5b9e\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4e0d\u5f71\u54cd\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "CINGS \u901a\u8fc7\u6539\u53d8\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u548c\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5bf9\u5916\u90e8\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u751f\u6210\u3002", "keywords": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b, \u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u8865\u5145, \u5e7b\u89c9\u51cf\u5c11, \u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u76d1\u7763, \u6587\u672c\u751f\u6210"}}

We show that reference-guided step-level evaluation effectively facilitates process supervision on four datasets spanning three domains: mathematical reasoning, multi-hop compositional question answering, and spatial reasoning.

Additionally, SPARE achieves competitive performance on challenging mathematical datasets while offering 2.6 times greater efficiency, requiring only 38% of the runtime, compared to tree search-based automatic annotation.

We identify and characterize a special structure in the loss landscape: channels along which the loss decreases extremely slowly, while the output weights of at least two neurons, $a_i$ and $a_j$, diverge to $\\pm$infinity, and their input weight vectors, $\\mathbf{w_i}$ and $\\mathbf{w_j}$, become equal to each other. At convergence, the two neurons implement a gated linear unit: $a_i\u03c3(\\mathbf{w_i} \\cdot \\mathbf{x}) + a_j\u03c3(\\mathbf{w_j} \\cdot \\mathbf{x}) \\rightarrow \u03c3(\\mathbf{w} \\cdot \\mathbf{x}) + (\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\mathbf{x}) \u03c3'(\\mathbf{w} \\cdot \\mathbf{x})$. Geometrically, these channels to infinity are asymptotically parallel to symmetry-induced lines of critical points. Gradient flow solvers, and related optimization methods like SGD or ADAM, reach the channels with high probability in diverse regression settings, but without careful inspection they look like flat local minima with finite parameter values. Our characterization provides a comprehensive picture of these quasi-flat regions in terms of gradient dynamics, geometry, and functional interpretation.

However, due to their semantic obscurity and expressive diversity, it is rather challenging to identify them. Existing methods mostly focus on superficial text features, ignoring the associations of hyperbole and metaphor as well as the effect of implicit emotion on perceiving these rhetorical devices. To implement these hypotheses, we propose an emotion-guided hyperbole and metaphor detection framework based on bidirectional dynamic interaction (EmoBi). Firstly, the emotion analysis module deeply mines the emotion connotations behind hyperbole and metaphor. Next, the emotion-based domain mapping module identifies the target and source domains to gain a deeper understanding of the implicit meanings of hyperbole and metaphor. Finally, the bidirectional dynamic interaction module enables the mutual promotion between hyperbole and metaphor. Meanwhile, a verification mechanism is designed to ensure detection accuracy and reliability. Experiments show that EmoBi outperforms all baseline methods on four datasets. Specifically, compared to the current SoTA, the F1 score increased by 28.1% for hyperbole detection on the TroFi dataset and 23.1% for metaphor detection on the HYPO-L dataset. These results, underpinned by in-depth analyses, underscore the effectiveness and potential of our approach for advancing hyperbole and metaphor detection.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u60c5\u611f\u5f15\u5bfc\u548c\u53cc\u5411\u52a8\u6001\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u5938\u5f20\u548c\u9690\u55bb\u68c0\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff08EmoBi\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u60c5\u611f\u5206\u6790\u548c\u57df\u6620\u5c04\u63d0\u5347\u68c0\u6d4b\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5938\u5f20\u548c\u9690\u55bb\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u8868\u5c42\u6587\u672c\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u60c5\u611f\u5173\u8054\u548c\u4fee\u8f9e\u8bbe\u5907\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u68c0\u6d4b\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002", "method": "EmoBi\u6846\u67b6\u5305\u62ec\u60c5\u611f\u5206\u6790\u6a21\u5757\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u60c5\u611f\u7684\u57df\u6620\u5c04\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u53cc\u5411\u52a8\u6001\u4ea4\u4e92\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6a21\u5757\u534f\u4f5c\u63d0\u5347\u68c0\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cEmoBi\u5728\u5938\u5f20\u548c\u9690\u55bb\u68c0\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0cF1\u5206\u6570\u5206\u522b\u63d0\u5347\u4e8628.1%\u548c23.1%\u3002", "conclusion": "EmoBi\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u60c5\u611f\u5f15\u5bfc\u548c\u53cc\u5411\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5938\u5f20\u548c\u9690\u55bb\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "keywords": "\u5938\u5f20\u68c0\u6d4b, \u9690\u55bb\u68c0\u6d4b, \u60c5\u611f\u5206\u6790, NLP, EmoBi"}}

Under review", "summary": "Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a promising approach to improve large language model (LLM) reasoning, yet most open efforts focus narrowly on math and code, limiting our understanding of its broader applicability to general reasoning. A key challenge lies in the lack of reliable, scalable RL reward signals across diverse reasoning domains. We introduce Guru, a curated RL reasoning corpus of 92K verifiable examples spanning six reasoning domains--Math, Code, Science, Logic, Simulation, and Tabular--each built through domain-specific reward design, deduplication, and filtering to ensure reliability and effectiveness for RL training. Based on Guru, we systematically revisit established findings in RL for LLM reasoning and observe significant variation across domains. For example, while prior work suggests that RL primarily elicits existing knowledge from pretrained models, our results reveal a more nuanced pattern: domains frequently seen during pretraining (Math, Code, Science) easily benefit from cross-domain RL training, while domains with limited pretraining exposure (Logic, Simulation, and Tabular) require in-domain training to achieve meaningful performance gains, suggesting that RL is likely to facilitate genuine skill acquisition. Finally, we present Guru-7B and Guru-32B, two models that achieve state-of-the-art performance among open models RL-trained with publicly available data, outperforming best baselines by 7.9% and 6.7% on our 17-task evaluation suite across six reasoning domains. We also show that our models effectively improve the Pass@k performance of their base models, particularly on complex tasks less likely to appear in pretraining data.

While retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with citation-based grounding holds promise, instruction-tuned models frequently fail even in straightforward scenarios: missing explicitly stated answers, citing incorrectly, or refusing when evidence is available. In this work, we explore how reinforcement learning (RL) and internal reasoning can enhance grounding in LLMs. We use the GRPO (Group Relative Policy Optimization) method to train models using verifiable outcome-based rewards targeting answer correctness, citation sufficiency, and refusal quality, without requiring gold reasoning traces or expensive annotations. Through comprehensive experiments across ASQA, QAMPARI, ELI5, and ExpertQA we show that reasoning-augmented models significantly outperform instruction-only variants, especially in handling unanswerable queries and generating well-cited responses.

This study presents a novel neural network architecture for forecasting three distinct types of violence -- state-based, non-state, and one-sided -- at the subnational (priogrid-month) level, up to 36 months in advance. The model jointly performs classification and regression tasks, producing both probabilistic estimates and expected magnitudes of future events. It achieves state-of-the-art performance across all tasks and generates approximate predictive posterior distributions to quantify forecast uncertainty.\n  The architecture is built on a Monte Carlo Dropout Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) U-Net, integrating convolutional layers to capture spatial dependencies with recurrent structures to model temporal dynamics. Unlike many existing approaches, it requires no manual feature engineering and relies solely on historical conflict data. This design enables the model to autonomously learn complex spatiotemporal patterns underlying violent conflict.\n  Beyond achieving state-of-the-art predictive performance, the model is also highly extensible: it can readily integrate additional data sources and jointly forecast auxiliary variables.

Prior work uses disagreement discrepancy (DIS^2) to derive practical error bounds under distribution shifts. It optimizes for a maximally disagreeing classifier on the target domain to bound the error of a given source classifier. Although this approach offers a reliable and competitively accurate estimate of the target error, we identify a problem in this approach which causes the disagreement discrepancy objective to compete in the overlapping region between source and target domains. With an intuitive assumption that the target disagreement should be no more than the source disagreement in the overlapping region due to high enough support, we devise Overlap-aware Disagreement Discrepancy (ODD). Maximizing ODD only requires disagreement in the non-overlapping target domain, removing the competition. Our ODD-based bound uses domain-classifiers to estimate domain-overlap and better predicts target performance than DIS^2.

However, the crucial choice of window size presents a Pareto tradeoff: larger windows maintain performance akin to full attention but offer minimal efficiency gains in short-context scenarios, while smaller windows can lead to performance degradation. Current models, such as Gemma2 and Mistral, adopt conservative window sizes (e.g., 4096 out of an 8192 pretraining length) to preserve performance. This work investigates strategies to shift this Pareto frontier, enabling local-global models to achieve efficiency gains even in short-context regimes. Our core motivation is to address the intrinsic limitation of local attention -- its complete disregard for tokens outside the defined window. We explore RATTENTION, a variant of local attention integrated with a specialized linear attention mechanism designed to capture information from these out-of-window tokens. Pretraining experiments at the 3B and 12B scales demonstrate that RATTENTION achieves a superior Pareto tradeoff between performance and efficiency. As a sweet spot, RATTENTION with a window size of just 512 consistently matches the performance of full-attention models across diverse settings. Furthermore, the recurrent nature inherent in the linear attention component of RATTENTION contributes to enhanced long-context performance, as validated on the RULER benchmark. Crucially, these improvements do not compromise training efficiency; thanks to a specialized kernel implementation and the reduced window size, RATTENTION maintains training speeds comparable to existing state-of-the-art approaches.", "AI": {"tldr": "RATTENTION\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u5c40\u90e8\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u548c\u7ebf\u6027\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u4e86\u7a97\u53e3\u5927\u5c0f\u7684\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u77ed\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u548c\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5c40\u90e8\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5b8c\u5168\u65e0\u89c6\u7a97\u53e3\u5916\u4ee4\u724c\u7684\u56fa\u6709\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5c40\u90e8\u5168\u5c40\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faRATTENTION\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5c40\u90e8\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u548c\u7ebf\u6027\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6355\u83b7\u7a97\u53e3\u5916\u4ee4\u724c\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "result": "\u57283B\u548c12B\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cRATTENTION\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u66f4\u4f18\u7684Pareto\u6298\u8877\uff0c\u7a97\u53e3\u5927\u5c0f\u4e3a512\u65f6\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u5168\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u5f53\u3002", "conclusion": "RATTENTION\u5728\u4e0d\u5f71\u54cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5c40\u90e8\u5168\u5c40\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u77ed\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u548c\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "keywords": "\u5c40\u90e8\u5168\u5c40\u6ce8\u610f\u529b, RATTENTION, \u7ebf\u6027\u6ce8\u610f\u529b, \u7a97\u53e3\u5927\u5c0f, \u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387"}}

However, their large size often leads to noticeable latency between the end of user input and the start of audio output, resulting in suboptimal user experiences. This latency is particularly evident when LLMs are deployed as single-user voice assistants on consumer-grade hardware with limited computing capacity. We discovered that this latency is primarily dominated by the time it takes for the LLMs to generate the first sentence, which is required as input by the TTS systems that synthesize audio responses on a sentence-by-sentence basis. To address this bottleneck, we propose Predictive Generation (PredGen), a novel framework that mitigates-or even eliminates-this delay through speculative decoding at input time. PredGen generates candidate responses while the user is still speaking, enabling the system to begin TTS processing with minimal delay. Simulated experiments on the Lmsys and MT-Bench datasets show that the proposed method can effectively reduce the latency by around 2x across a wide range of use cases, while incurring only minimal additional computation cost at input time-computation that would otherwise go unused.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faPredictive Generation (PredGen)\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u63a8\u6d4b\u6027\u89e3\u7801\u5728\u7528\u6237\u8bf4\u8bdd\u65f6\u751f\u6210\u5019\u9009\u54cd\u5e94\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11LLMs\u4e0eTTS\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3LLMs\u5728\u5b9e\u65f6\u8bed\u97f3\u804a\u5929\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u56e0\u751f\u6210\u9996\u53e5\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u5ef6\u8fdf\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u7528\u6237\u4f53\u9a8c\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528Predictive Generation (PredGen)\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u7528\u6237\u8f93\u5165\u65f6\u8fdb\u884c\u63a8\u6d4b\u6027\u89e3\u7801\uff0c\u63d0\u524d\u751f\u6210\u5019\u9009\u54cd\u5e94\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793aPredGen\u53ef\u5c06\u5ef6\u8fdf\u964d\u4f4e\u7ea62\u500d\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4ec5\u589e\u52a0\u5c11\u91cf\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3002", "conclusion": "PredGen\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86LLMs\u4e0eTTS\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5ef6\u8fdf\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u8ba1\u7b97\u80fd\u529b\u6709\u9650\u7684\u8bbe\u5907\u3002", "keywords": "Large Language Models, Predictive Generation, latency, text-to-speech, real-time voice chat"}}

While previous works have explored representation learning for this task, the critical challenge of training instability in sequential representations and its detrimental impact on policy performance has been overlooked. This work demonstrates that Controlled Differential Equations (CDE) state representation can achieve strong RL policies when two key factors are met: (1) ensuring training stability through early stopping or stabilization methods, and (2) enforcing acuity-aware representations by correlation regularization with clinical scores (SOFA, SAPS-II, OASIS). Experiments on the MIMIC-III sepsis cohort reveal that stable CDE autoencoder produces representations strongly correlated with acuity scores and enables RL policies with superior performance (WIS return $> 0.9$). In contrast, unstable CDE representation leads to degraded representations and policy failure (WIS return $\\sim$ 0). Visualizations of the latent space show that stable CDEs not only separate survivor and non-survivor trajectories but also reveal clear acuity score gradients, whereas unstable training fails to capture either pattern.

We propose the GraphGSOcc model, a novel framework that combines semantic and geometric graph Transformer for 3D Gaussian Splating-based Occupancy Prediction. We propose the Dual Gaussians Graph Attenntion, which dynamically constructs dual graph structures: a geometric graph adaptively calculating KNN search radii based on Gaussian poses, enabling large-scale Gaussians to aggregate features from broader neighborhoods while compact Gaussians focus on local geometric consistency; a semantic graph retaining top-M highly correlated nodes via cosine similarity to explicitly encode semantic relationships within and across instances.

However, existing SFT methods typically treat each training instance as a uniform sequence, giving equal importance to all tokens regardless of their relevance. This overlooks the fact that only a subset of tokens often contains critical, task-specific information. To address this limitation, we introduce Supervised Fine-Tuning with Group Optimization (SFT-GO), a novel approach that treats groups of tokens differently based on their importance.SFT-GO groups tokens in each sample based on their importance values and optimizes the LLM using a weighted combination of the worst-group loss and the standard cross-entropy loss. This mechanism adaptively emphasizes the most challenging token groups and guides the model to better handle different group distributions, thereby improving overall learning dynamics. We provide a theoretical analysis of SFT-GO's convergence rate, demonstrating its efficiency. Empirically, we apply SFT-GO with three different token grouping strategies and show that models trained with SFT-GO consistently outperform baseline approaches across popular LLM benchmarks.

This elicits the requirement of group identification (GI), which is to recommend groups to users. We reveal that users are influenced by both group-level and item-level interests, and these dual-level interests have a collaborative evolution relationship: joining a group expands the user's item interests, further prompting the user to join new groups. Ultimately, the two interests tend to align dynamically. However, existing GI methods fail to fully model this collaborative evolution relationship, ignoring the enhancement of group-level interests on item-level interests, and suffering from false-negative samples when aligning cross-level interests. In order to fully model the collaborative evolution relationship between dual-level user interests, we propose CI4GI, a Collaborative Interest-aware model for Group Identification. Specifically, we design an interest enhancement strategy that identifies additional interests of users from the items interacted with by the groups they have joined as a supplement to item-level interests. In addition, we adopt the distance between interest distributions of two users to optimize the identification of negative samples for a user, mitigating the interference of false-negative samples during cross-level interests alignment.

To make this process more efficient, several methods have been proposed to optimize model architecture/parametrization and hardware use. On the parametrization side, $\u03bcP$ (Maximal Update Parametrization) parametrizes model weights and learning rate (LR) in a way that makes hyperparameters (HPs) transferable with width (embedding dimension): HPs can be tuned for a small model and used for larger models without additional tuning. While $\u03bc$P showed impressive results in practice, recent empirical studies have reported conflicting observations when applied to LLMs. One limitation of the theory behind $\u03bc$P is the fact that input dimension (vocabulary size in LLMs) is considered fixed when taking the width to infinity. This is unrealistic since vocabulary size is generally much larger than width in practice. In this work, we provide a theoretical analysis of the effect of vocabulary size on training dynamics, and subsequently show that as vocabulary size increases, the training dynamics \\emph{interpolate between the $\u03bc$P regime and another regime that we call Large Vocab (LV) Regime}, where optimal scaling rules are different from those predicted by $\u03bc$P. Our analysis reveals that in the LV regime, the optimal embedding LR to hidden LR ratio should roughly scale as $\u0398(\\sqrt{width})$, surprisingly close to the empirical findings previously reported in the literature, and different from the $\u0398(width)$ ratio predicted by $\u03bc$P.

Current approaches typically merge sentence-level parsing outputs for discourse input, often missing phenomena like cross-sentence coreference, resulting in fragmented graphs and degraded downstream VLM task performance. To address this, we introduce a new task, Discourse-level text Scene Graph parsing (DiscoSG), supported by our dataset DiscoSG-DS, which comprises 400 expert-annotated and 8,430 synthesised multi-sentence caption-graph pairs for images. Each caption averages 9 sentences, and each graph contains at least 3 times more triples than those in existing datasets. While fine-tuning large PLMs (i.e., GPT-4) on DiscoSG-DS improves SPICE by approximately 48% over the best sentence-merging baseline, high inference cost and restrictive licensing hinder its open-source use, and smaller fine-tuned PLMs struggle with complex graphs. We propose DiscoSG-Refiner, which drafts a base graph using one small PLM, then employs a second PLM to iteratively propose graph edits, reducing full-graph generation overhead. Using two Flan-T5-Base models, DiscoSG-Refiner still improves SPICE by approximately 30% over the best baseline while achieving 86 times faster inference than GPT-4.

Existing approaches have primarily treated this challenge as a binary classification task, offering limited insight into where or why a model identifies a video as AI-generated. However, the core challenge extends beyond simply detecting subtle artifacts; it requires providing fine-grained, persuasive evidence that can convince auditors and end-users alike. To address this critical gap, we introduce DAVID-X, the first dataset to pair AI-generated videos with detailed defect-level, temporal-spatial annotations and written rationales. Leveraging these rich annotations, we present DAVID-XR1, a video-language model designed to deliver an interpretable chain of visual reasoning-including defect categorization, temporal-spatial localization, and natural language explanations. This approach fundamentally transforms AI-generated video detection from an opaque black-box decision into a transparent and verifiable diagnostic process.

Our experiments demonstrate that models gain performance when retrained with SPG on their original datasets and also outperform standard transfer fine-tuning.

For example, identifying and engaging motivated collaborators who are willing to co-design and deploy AI based solutions in real-world settings is often difficult. Even when such partnerships are established, many AI4SI projects \"fail\" to progress beyond the proof-of-concept stage, and hence, are unable to transition to at-scale production-level solutions. Furthermore, the unique challenges faced by AI4SI researchers are not always fully recognized within the broader AI community, where such work is sometimes viewed as primarily applied and not aligning with the traditional criteria for novelty emphasized in core AI venues. This paper attempts to shine a light on the diverse challenges faced in AI4SI research by diagnosing a multitude of factors that prevent AI4SI partnerships from achieving real-world impact on the ground. Drawing on semi-structured interviews with six leading AI4SI researchers - complemented by the authors' own lived experiences in conducting AI4SI research - this paper attempts to understand the day-to-day difficulties faced in developing and deploying socially impactful AI solutions. Through thematic analysis, we identify structural and organizational, communication, collaboration, and operational challenges as key barriers to deployment. While there are no easy fixes, we synthesize best practices and actionable strategies drawn from these interviews and our own work in this space.

Specifically, we show that Muon corresponds to Lion-$\\mathcal{K}$ when equipped with the nuclear norm, and we leverage the theoretical results of Lion-$\\mathcal{K}$ to establish that Muon (with decoupled weight decay) implicitly solves an optimization problem that enforces a constraint on the spectral norm of weight matrices. This perspective not only demystifies the implicit regularization effects of Muon but also leads to natural generalizations through varying the choice of convex map $\\mathcal{K}$, allowing for the exploration of a broader class of implicitly regularized and constrained optimization algorithms.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06Muon\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u7eb3\u5165Lion-$\u05e9$\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u5bb6\u65cf\u8fdb\u884c\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86Muon\u7684\u6838\u8303\u6570\u7279\u6027\u53ca\u5176\u901a\u8fc7\u9690\u5f0f\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u89e3\u51b3\u6743\u91cd\u77e9\u9635\u8c31\u8303\u6570\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u63a2\u7d22\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "motivation": "Muon\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u5728\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7406\u8bba\u652f\u6301\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u5c06Muon\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u4e0eLion-$\u05e9$\u5bb6\u65cf\u5173\u8054\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5176\u6838\u8303\u6570\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528Lion-$\u05e9$\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u7ed3\u679c\u89e3\u91caMuon\u7684\u9690\u5f0f\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u3002", "result": "Muon\u5728\u89e3\u8026\u6743\u91cd\u8870\u51cf\u4e0b\u53ef\u9690\u5f0f\u89e3\u51b3\u6743\u91cd\u77e9\u9635\u8c31\u8303\u6570\u7ea6\u675f\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6539\u53d8\u51f8\u6620\u5c04$\u05e9$\u7684\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u53ef\u63a2\u7d22\u66f4\u591a\u9690\u5f0f\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u548c\u7ea6\u675f\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "keywords": "Muon\u4f18\u5316\u5668, Lion-$\u05e9$, \u6838\u8303\u6570, \u9690\u5f0f\u6b63\u5219\u5316, \u8c31\u8303\u6570\u7ea6\u675f"}}

Recent advances in generative AI provide an opportunity to automate MCQ generation efficiently. However, assessing the actual quality and reliability of generated MCQs has received limited attention -- particularly regarding cases where generation fails. This aspect becomes particularly important when the generated MCQs are meant to be applied in real-world settings. Additionally, most MCQ generation studies focus on English, leaving other languages underexplored. This paper investigates the capabilities of current generative models in producing MCQs for reading comprehension in Portuguese, a morphologically rich language. Our study focuses on generating MCQs that align with curriculum-relevant narrative elements and span different difficulty levels. We evaluate these MCQs through expert review and by analyzing the psychometric properties extracted from student responses to assess their suitability for elementary school students. Our results show that current models can generate MCQs of comparable quality to human-authored ones. However, we identify issues related to semantic clarity and answerability. Also, challenges remain in generating distractors that engage students and meet established criteria for high-quality MCQ option design.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5229\u7528\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u8461\u8404\u7259\u8bed\u9605\u8bfb\u7406\u89e3\u7684MCQs\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u5173\u6ce8\u4e0e\u8bfe\u7a0b\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u53d9\u8ff0\u5143\u7d20\u548c\u4e0d\u540c\u96be\u5ea6\u7ea7\u522b\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4e13\u5bb6\u8bc4\u5ba1\u548c\u5b66\u751f\u53cd\u9988\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1MCQs\u5bf9\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u5f88\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u4f46\u624b\u52a8\u521b\u5efa\u4e0d\u540c\u96be\u5ea6\u548c\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u9605\u8bfb\u6280\u80fd\u7684MCQs\u8017\u65f6\u4e14\u6602\u8d35\u3002\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u7684\u8fdb\u6b65\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u53ef\u80fd\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u5176\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5176\u4ed6\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u751f\u6210\u7814\u7a76\u8f83\u5c11\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u4f7f\u7528\u5f53\u524d\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u4e3a\u8461\u8404\u7259\u8bed\u9605\u8bfb\u7406\u89e3\u751f\u6210MCQs\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u8bfe\u7a0b\u76f8\u5173\u53d9\u8ff0\u5143\u7d20\u548c\u4e0d\u540c\u96be\u5ea6\u7ea7\u522b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e13\u5bb6\u8bc4\u5ba1\u548c\u5b66\u751f\u53cd\u9988\u7684\u5fc3\u7406\u5b66\u6307\u6807\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u5f53\u524d\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u4eba\u5de5\u7f16\u5199\u8d28\u91cf\u76f8\u5f53\u7684MCQs\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u5b58\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u6e05\u6670\u5ea6\u3001\u53ef\u56de\u7b54\u6027\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e14\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u5e72\u6270\u9879\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4ecd\u6709\u6311\u6218\u3002", "conclusion": "\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u5728MCQ\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u548c\u5e72\u6270\u9879\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b9\u9762\u4ecd\u9700\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u975e\u82f1\u8bed\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u3002", "keywords": "MCQ\u751f\u6210,\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI,\u8461\u8404\u7259\u8bed,\u9605\u8bfb\u7406\u89e3,\u96be\u5ea6\u7ea7\u522b"}}

Non-convex optimization and numerous hyperparameters to tune make performance improvement difficult, and traditional approaches often prioritize minimizing mean squared error (MSE) while overlooking $L^{\\infty}$ error, which is the critical focus in many applications. To address these challenges, we present a progressive framework for training and tuning high-precision neural networks (HiPreNets). Our approach refines a previously explored staged training technique for neural networks that improves an existing fully connected neural network by sequentially learning its prediction residuals using additional networks, leading to improved overall accuracy.

Studying the regret mechanism is crucial for enhancing model reliability and helps in revealing how cognition is coded in neural networks. To understand this mechanism, we need to first identify regret expressions in model outputs, then analyze their internal representation. This analysis requires examining the model's hidden states, where information processing occurs at the neuron level. However, this faces three key challenges: (1) the absence of specialized datasets capturing regret expressions, (2) the lack of metrics to find the optimal regret representation layer, and (3) the lack of metrics for identifying and analyzing regret neurons. Addressing these limitations, we propose: (1) a workflow for constructing a comprehensive regret dataset through strategically designed prompting scenarios, (2) the Supervised Compression-Decoupling Index (S-CDI) metric to identify optimal regret representation layers, and (3) the Regret Dominance Score (RDS) metric to identify regret neurons and the Group Impact Coefficient (GIC) to analyze activation patterns. Our experimental results successfully identified the optimal regret representation layer using the S-CDI metric, which significantly enhanced performance in probe classification experiments. Additionally, we discovered an M-shaped decoupling pattern across model layers, revealing how information processing alternates between coupling and decoupling phases.

Our goal is to understand to what extent hallucinations occur, what types of inconsistencies trigger them, and how current models respond. To achieve these goals, we construct a hallucination probing set by building on an existing benchmark, capable of inducing hallucination rates up to 40x higher than base prompts.

Our model comparisons suggested that cross-cultural differences in intensifier interpretation stem from a combination of (1) different literal meanings, (2) different weights on utterance cost.

However, pervasive missing data caused by sensor failures and heterogeneous sensing gaps fundamentally hinders reliable traffic modeling. This paper proposes a Neural Canonical Polyadic Factorization (NCPF) model that synergizes low-rank tensor algebra with deep representation learning for robust traffic data imputation. The model innovatively embeds CP decomposition into neural architecture through learnable embedding projections, where sparse traffic tensors are encoded into dense latent factors across road segments, time intervals, and mobility metrics.

However, when focusing on instruction-following capabilities, if a prompt specifies a concept order, LLMs must generate sentences that adhere to the specified order. To address this, we propose Ordered CommonGen, a benchmark designed to evaluate the compositional generalization and instruction-following abilities of LLMs. This benchmark measures ordered coverage to assess whether concepts are generated in the specified order, enabling a simultaneous evaluation of both abilities. We conducted a comprehensive analysis using 36 LLMs and found that, while LLMs generally understand the intent of instructions, biases toward specific concept order patterns often lead to low-diversity outputs or identical results even when the concept order is altered.

Traditional DR diagnosis relies on the manual examination of retinal fundus images, which is both time-consuming and resource intensive. This study presents a novel solution using Edge Impulse to deploy multiple deep learning models for real-time DR detection on edge devices. A robust dataset of over 3,662 retinal fundus images, sourced from the Kaggle EyePACS dataset, was curated, and enhanced through preprocessing techniques, including augmentation and normalization. Using TensorFlow, various Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), such as MobileNet, ShuffleNet, SqueezeNet, and a custom Deep Neural Network (DNN), were designed, trained, and optimized for edge deployment. The models were converted to TensorFlowLite and quantized to 8-bit integers to reduce their size and enhance inference speed, with minimal trade-offs in accuracy. Performance evaluations across different edge hardware platforms, including smartphones and microcontrollers, highlighted key metrics such as inference speed, accuracy, precision, and resource utilization. MobileNet achieved an accuracy of 96.45%, while SqueezeNet demonstrated strong real-time performance with a small model size of 176 KB and latency of just 17 ms on GPU. ShuffleNet and the custom DNN achieved moderate accuracy but excelled in resource efficiency, making them suitable for lower-end devices.

However, a fundamental challenge in this field lies in effectively verifying whether unlearning operations have been successfully and thoroughly executed. Despite a growing body of work on unlearning techniques, verification methodologies remain comparatively underexplored and often fragmented. Existing approaches lack a unified taxonomy and a systematic framework for evaluation. To bridge this gap, this paper presents the first structured survey of machine unlearning verification methods. We propose a taxonomy that organizes current techniques into two principal categories -- behavioral verification and parametric verification -- based on the type of evidence used to assess unlearning fidelity. We examine representative methods within each category, analyze their underlying assumptions, strengths, and limitations, and identify potential vulnerabilities in practical deployment. In closing, we articulate a set of open problems in current verification research, aiming to provide a foundation for developing more robust, efficient, and theoretically grounded unlearning verification mechanisms.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u662f\u9996\u6b21\u5bf9\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u9057\u5fd8\u9a8c\u8bc1\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7efc\u8ff0\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5206\u7c7b\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\u5206\u4e3a\u884c\u4e3a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u548c\u53c2\u6570\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e24\u5927\u7c7b\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5b83\u4eec\u7684\u4f18\u7f3a\u70b9\u53ca\u6f5c\u5728\u6f0f\u6d1e\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u548c\u6cd5\u5f8b\u5408\u89c4\u6027\u9700\u6c42\u7684\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u9057\u5fd8\u6280\u672f\u53d8\u5f97\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u9a8c\u8bc1\u9057\u5fd8\u64cd\u4f5c\u662f\u5426\u6210\u529f\u6267\u884c\u7684\u9886\u57df\u4ecd\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5206\u7c7b\u6cd5\u5c06\u65b9\u6cd5\u5206\u4e3a\u884c\u4e3a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u548c\u53c2\u6570\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\u3001\u5047\u8bbe\u3001\u4f18\u7f3a\u70b9\u53ca\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u6f0f\u6d1e\u3002", "result": "\u603b\u7ed3\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6280\u672f\u7684\u7279\u70b9\u548c\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u4e86\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u53ef\u80fd\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u7684\u5f00\u653e\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u5065\u58ee\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u673a\u5236\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "keywords": "\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u9057\u5fd8, \u9a8c\u8bc1\u65b9\u6cd5, \u884c\u4e3a\u9a8c\u8bc1, \u53c2\u6570\u9a8c\u8bc1, \u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4"}}

This task requires MLLMs to generate executable code that can reproduce a given chart, demanding not only precise visual understanding but also accurate translation of visual elements into structured code. Directly prompting MLLMs to perform this complex task often yields unsatisfactory results. To address this challenge, we propose {ChartIR}, an iterative refinement method based on structured instruction. First, we distinguish two tasks: visual understanding and code translation. To accomplish the visual understanding component, we design two types of structured instructions: description and difference. The description instruction captures the visual elements of the reference chart, while the difference instruction characterizes the discrepancies between the reference chart and the generated chart. These instructions effectively transform visual features into language representations, thereby facilitating the subsequent code translation process. Second, we decompose the overall chart generation pipeline into two stages: initial code generation and iterative refinement, enabling progressive enhancement of the final output.

A common strategy involves integrating Byzantine-resilient aggregation rules with differential privacy mechanisms. However, the incorporation of these techniques often results in a significant degradation in model accuracy. To address this issue, we propose a decentralized DML framework, named ImprovDML, that achieves high model accuracy while simultaneously ensuring privacy preservation and resilience to Byzantine attacks. The framework leverages a kind of resilient vector consensus algorithms that can compute a point within the normal (non-Byzantine) agents' convex hull for resilient aggregation at each iteration. Then, multivariate Gaussian noises are introduced to the gradients for privacy preservation. We provide convergence guarantees and derive asymptotic learning error bounds under non-convex settings, which are tighter than those reported in existing works. For the privacy analysis, we adopt the notion of concentrated geo-privacy, which quantifies privacy preservation based on the Euclidean distance between inputs. We demonstrate that it enables an improved trade-off between privacy preservation and model accuracy compared to differential privacy.

Across tasks, it identifies reusable skill components, learns continuously evolving compositional policies, and generates realistic trajectories beyond the capabilities of traditional discrete models.

Unlike final outputs, reasoning traces are often assumed to be internal and safe. We challenge this assumption by showing that reasoning traces frequently contain sensitive user data, which can be extracted via prompt injections or accidentally leak into outputs. Through probing and agentic evaluations, we demonstrate that test-time compute approaches, particularly increased reasoning steps, amplify such leakage. While increasing the budget of those test-time compute approaches makes models more cautious in their final answers, it also leads them to reason more verbosely and leak more in their own thinking. This reveals a core tension: reasoning improves utility but enlarges the privacy attack surface.

This paper proposes the Best Kernel Size Estimation Function (BKSEF), a mathematically grounded and empirically validated framework for optimal, layer-wise kernel size determination. BKSEF balances information gain, computational efficiency, and accuracy improvements by integrating principles from information theory, signal processing, and learning theory. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet-lite, ChestX-ray14, and GTSRB datasets demonstrate that BKSEF-guided architectures achieve up to 3.1 percent accuracy improvement and 42.8 percent reduction in FLOPs compared to traditional models using uniform 3x3 kernels. Two real-world case studies further validate the approach: one for medical image classification in a cloud-based setup, and another for traffic sign recognition on edge devices. The former achieved enhanced interpretability and accuracy, while the latter reduced latency and model size significantly, with minimal accuracy trade-off. These results show that kernel size can be an active, optimizable parameter rather than a fixed heuristic.

For scientific applications, actual quantitative accuracy is crucial. This work applies the rigor of numerical analysis for differential equations to machine learning by specifically quantifying the accuracy of applying different ML techniques to the elementary 1D Poisson differential equation. Beyond the quantity and discretization of data, we identify that the function space of the data is critical to the generalization of the model. We prove generalization bounds and convergence rates under finite data discretizations and restricted training data subspaces by analyzing the training dynamics and deriving optimal parameters for both a white-box differential equation discovery method and a black-box linear model. The analytically derived generalization bounds are replicated empirically. Similar lack of generalization is empirically demonstrated for deep linear models, shallow neural networks, and physics-specific DeepONets and Neural Operators. We theoretically and empirically demonstrate that generalization to the true physical equation is not guaranteed in each explored case. Surprisingly, we find that different classes of models can exhibit opposing generalization behaviors. Based on our theoretical analysis, we also demonstrate a new mechanistic interpretability lens on scientific models whereby Green's function representations can be extracted from the weights of black-box models.

Significant recent research established the requirements that the input must satisfy in order to guarantee convergence of the training loop. This line of work uses averaging as the aggregation rule for the training models. In particular, we are interested in whether federated learning is robust to Byzantine behavior, and observe and investigate a tradeoff between the average/centroid and the validity conditions from distributed computing. We show that the various validity conditions alone do not guarantee a good approximation of the average. Furthermore, we show that reaching good approximation does not give good results in experimental settings due to possible Byzantine outliers. Our main contribution is the first lower bound of $\\min\\{\\frac{n-t}{t},\\sqrt{d}\\}$ on the centroid approximation under box validity that is often considered in the literature, where $n$ is the number of clients, $t$ the upper bound on the number of Byzantine faults, and $d$ is the dimension of the machine learning model. We complement this lower bound by an upper bound of $2\\min\\{n,\\sqrt{d}\\}$, by providing a new analysis for the case $n<d$.

Users could easily possess private LLMs by fine-tuning an open-source one with private corpora, resulting in a significant performance drop of existing detectors in practice. To address this issue, we propose PhantomHunter, an LLM-generated text detector specialized for detecting text from unseen, privately-tuned LLMs. Its family-aware learning framework captures family-level traits shared across the base models and their derivatives, instead of memorizing individual characteristics.

However, conventional annotation methods heavily rely on time-consuming manual labeling by human annotators, introducing non-robust frame selection and increasing operational costs. To address these challenges in the retail domain, we propose a deep learning-based approach that automates key-frame identification in retail videos and provides automatic annotations of products and customers. Our method leverages deep neural networks to learn discriminative features by embedding video frames and incorporating object detection-based techniques tailored for retail environments. Experimental results showcase the superiority of our approach over traditional methods, achieving accuracy comparable to human annotator labeling while enhancing the overall efficiency of retail video annotation. Remarkably, our approach leads to an average of 2 times cost savings in video annotation. By allowing human annotators to verify/adjust less than 5% of detected frames in the video dataset, while automating the annotation process for the remaining frames without reducing annotation quality, retailers can significantly reduce operational costs. The automation of key-frame detection enables substantial time and effort savings in retail video labeling tasks, proving highly valuable for diverse retail applications such as shopper journey analysis, product interaction detection, and in-store security monitoring.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u96f6\u552e\u89c6\u9891\u5173\u952e\u5e27\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc6\u522b\u4e0e\u6807\u6ce8\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6807\u6ce8\u6548\u7387\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u96f6\u552e\u89c6\u9891\u6807\u6ce8\u4f9d\u8d56\u4eba\u5de5\uff0c\u8d39\u65f6\u4e14\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u96f6\u552e\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7f51\u7edc\u5d4c\u5165\u89c6\u9891\u5e27\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u96f6\u552e\u73af\u5883\u5b9a\u5236\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc6\u522b\u5173\u952e\u5e27\u5e76\u6807\u6ce8\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6807\u6ce8\u51c6\u786e\u5ea6\u63a5\u8fd1\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\uff0c\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u53472\u500d\uff0c\u4e14\u4ec5\u9700\u4eba\u5de5\u9a8c\u8bc15%\u7684\u5e27\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u96f6\u552e\u89c6\u9891\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u79cd\u96f6\u552e\u573a\u666f\u5206\u6790\u3002", "keywords": "\u96f6\u552e\u89c6\u9891\u6807\u6ce8, \u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60, \u5173\u952e\u5e27\u68c0\u6d4b, \u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b, \u6210\u672c\u8282\u7701"}}

Dataset Inference (DI) offers a potential remedy by identifying whether a suspect dataset was used in training, thereby enabling data owners to verify unauthorized use. However, existing DI methods require a private set-known to be absent from training-that closely matches the compromised dataset's distribution. Such in-distribution, held-out data is rarely available in practice, severely limiting the applicability of DI. In this work, we address this challenge by synthetically generating the required held-out set. Our approach tackles two key obstacles: (1) creating high-quality, diverse synthetic data that accurately reflects the original distribution, which we achieve via a data generator trained on a carefully designed suffix-based completion task, and (2) bridging likelihood gaps between real and synthetic data, which is realized through post-hoc calibration. Extensive experiments on diverse text datasets show that using our generated data as a held-out set enables DI to detect the original training sets with high confidence, while maintaining a low false positive rate.

Whereas most prior studies optimise charging locations for single cities, state-wide and national networks must reconcile the conflicting requirements of dense metropolitan cores, car-dependent exurbs, and power-constrained rural corridors.\n  We present DOVA-PATBM (Deployment Optimisation with Voronoi-oriented, Adaptive, POI-Aware Temporal Behaviour Model), a geo-computational framework that unifies these contexts in a single pipeline. The method rasterises heterogeneous data (roads, population, night lights, POIs, and feeder lines) onto a hierarchical H3 grid, infers intersection importance with a zone-normalised graph neural network centrality model, and overlays a Voronoi tessellation that guarantees at least one five-port DC fast charger within every 30 km radius. Hourly arrival profiles, learned from loop-detector and floating-car traces, feed a finite M/M/c queue to size ports under feeder-capacity and outage-risk constraints. A greedy maximal-coverage heuristic with income-weighted penalties then selects the minimum number of sites that satisfy coverage and equity targets.\n  Applied to the State of Georgia, USA, DOVA-PATBM (i) increases 30 km tile coverage by 12 percentage points, (ii) halves the mean distance that low-income residents travel to the nearest charger, and (iii) meets sub-transmission headroom everywhere -- all while remaining computationally tractable for national-scale roll-outs.

Under review for NeurIPS 2025", "summary": "Some perspectives naturally provide more information than others. How can an AI system determine which viewpoint offers the most valuable insight for accurate and efficient 3D object reconstruction? Active view selection (AVS) for 3D reconstruction remains a fundamental challenge in computer vision. The aim is to identify the minimal set of views that yields the most accurate 3D reconstruction. Instead of learning radiance fields, like NeRF or 3D Gaussian Splatting, from a current observation and computing uncertainty for each candidate viewpoint, we introduce a novel AVS approach guided by neural uncertainty maps predicted by a lightweight feedforward deep neural network, named UPNet. UPNet takes a single input image of a 3D object and outputs a predicted uncertainty map, representing uncertainty values across all possible candidate viewpoints. By leveraging heuristics derived from observing many natural objects and their associated uncertainty patterns, we train UPNet to learn a direct mapping from viewpoint appearance to uncertainty in the underlying volumetric representations. Next, our approach aggregates all previously predicted neural uncertainty maps to suppress redundant candidate viewpoints and effectively select the most informative one. Using these selected viewpoints, we train 3D neural rendering models and evaluate the quality of novel view synthesis against other competitive AVS methods. Remarkably, despite using half of the viewpoints than the upper bound, our method achieves comparable reconstruction accuracy. In addition, it significantly reduces computational overhead during AVS, achieving up to a 400 times speedup along with over 50\\% reductions in CPU, RAM, and GPU usage compared to baseline methods.

Third-party logistics (3PL)-led supply chain finance (SCF) has emerged as a promising solution, leveraging in-transit inventory as collateral. We propose an advanced credit risk management framework tailored for 3PL-led SCF, addressing the dual challenges of credit risk assessment and loan size determination. Specifically, we leverage conditional generative modeling of sales distributions through Quantile-Regression-based Generative Metamodeling (QRGMM) as the foundation for risk estimation. We propose a unified framework that enables flexible estimation of multiple risk measures while introducing a functional risk measure formulation that systematically captures the relationship between these risk measures and varying loan levels, supported by theoretical guarantees.

However, the diversity of model implementations and training strategies across recent TFMs, though promising, makes it challenging to isolate the contribution of individual design choices or evaluate their potential synergies. This hinders the field's ability to converge on best practices and limits the reproducibility of insights across studies. We present BMFM-RNA, an open-source, modular software package that unifies diverse TFM pretraining and fine-tuning objectives within a single framework. Leveraging this capability, we introduce a novel training objective, whole cell expression decoder (WCED), which captures global expression patterns using an autoencoder-like CLS bottleneck representation. In this paper, we describe the framework, supported input representations, and training objectives. We evaluated four model checkpoints pretrained on CELLxGENE using combinations of masked language modeling (MLM), WCED and multitask learning. Using the benchmarking capabilities of BMFM-RNA, we show that WCED-based models achieve performance that matches or exceeds state-of-the-art approaches like scGPT across more than a dozen datasets in both zero-shot and fine-tuning tasks. BMFM-RNA, available as part of the biomed-multi-omics project ( https://github.com/BiomedSciAI/biomed-multi-omic ), offers a reproducible foundation for systematic benchmarking and community-driven exploration of optimal TFM training strategies, enabling the development of more effective tools to leverage the latest advances in AI for understanding cell biology.", "AI": {"tldr": "BMFM-RNA\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5f00\u6e90\u3001\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u7684\u8f6c\u5f55\u7ec4\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff08TFM\uff09\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5305\uff0c\u7edf\u4e00\u4e86\u591a\u79cd\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u5fae\u8c03\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u65b0\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u76ee\u6807WCED\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f53\u524d\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dTFMs\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u5dee\u5f02\u5bfc\u81f4\u96be\u4ee5\u8bc4\u4f30\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9009\u62e9\u6216\u534f\u540c\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u9886\u57df\u5185\u6700\u4f73\u5b9e\u8df5\u7684\u8fbe\u6210\u548c\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faBMFM-RNA\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u591a\u79cd\u8f93\u5165\u8868\u793a\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u65b0\u7684WCED\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8eCELLxGENE\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u6027\u80fd\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "WCED\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u548c\u5fae\u8c03\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u6027\u80fd\u8d85\u8fc7scGPT\u7b49\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "BMFM-RNA\u4e3a\u7cfb\u7edf\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548c\u793e\u533a\u9a71\u52a8\u7684TFM\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u63a2\u7d22\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "keywords": "\u8f6c\u5f55\u7ec4\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b, WCED, BMFM-RNA, \u9884\u8bad\u7ec3, \u5fae\u8c03"}}

Secure multi-party computation (MPC)-based privacy-preserving machine learning offers a powerful approach to protect both model parameters and user data, but its application to LLMs has been largely limited to inference, as fine-tuning introduces significant computational challenges, particularly in privacy-preserving backward propagation and optimizer operations. This paper identifies two primary obstacles to MPC-based privacy-preserving fine-tuning of LLMs: (1) the substantial computational overhead of backward and optimizer processes, and (2) the inefficiency of softmax-based attention mechanisms in MPC settings. To address these challenges, we propose SecFwT, the first MPC-based framework designed for efficient, privacy-preserving LLM fine-tuning. SecFwT introduces a forward-only tuning paradigm to eliminate backward and optimizer computations and employs MPC-friendly Random Feature Attention to approximate softmax attention, significantly reducing costly non-linear operations and computational complexity. Experimental results demonstrate that SecFwT delivers substantial improvements in efficiency and privacy preservation, enabling scalable and secure fine-tuning of LLMs for privacy-critical applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aSecFwT\u7684MPC\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u7684\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8e\u9690\u79c1\u8981\u6c42\u4e25\u683c\uff0c\u9690\u79c1\u654f\u611f\u9886\u57df\uff08\u5982\u533b\u7597\u548c\u91d1\u878d\uff09\u7684LLM\u5fae\u8c03\u9762\u4e34\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "SecFwT\u91c7\u7528\u524d\u5411\u8c03\u6574\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u53cd\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528MPC\u53cb\u597d\u7684\u968f\u673a\u7279\u5f81\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u8fd1\u4f3csoftmax\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cSecFwT\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55LLM\u5fae\u8c03\u3002", "conclusion": "SecFwT\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4LLM\u5fae\u8c03\u4e2d\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u6548\u7387\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "keywords": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\uff0c\u591a\u5b89\u5168\u65b9\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u968f\u673a\u7279\u5f81\u6ce8\u610f\u529b"}}

This study introduces a topological framework for identifying structural change in media narratives using persistent homology. Drawing on international news articles surrounding major events - including the Russian invasion of Ukraine (Feb 2022), the murder of George Floyd (May 2020), the U.S. Capitol insurrection (Jan 2021), and the Hamas-led invasion of Israel (Oct 2023) - we construct daily co-occurrence graphs of noun phrases to trace evolving discourse. Each graph is embedded and transformed into a persistence diagram via a Vietoris-Rips filtration. We then compute Wasserstein distances and persistence entropies across homological dimensions to capture semantic disruption and narrative volatility over time. Our results show that major geopolitical and social events align with sharp spikes in both H0 (connected components) and H1 (loops), indicating sudden reorganization in narrative structure and coherence. Cross-correlation analyses reveal a typical lag pattern in which changes to component-level structure (H0) precede higher-order motif shifts (H1), suggesting a bottom-up cascade of semantic change. An exception occurs during the Russian invasion of Ukraine, where H1 entropy leads H0, possibly reflecting top-down narrative framing before local discourse adjusts. Persistence entropy further distinguishes tightly focused from diffuse narrative regimes. These findings demonstrate that persistent homology offers a mathematically principled, unsupervised method for detecting inflection points and directional shifts in public attention - without requiring prior knowledge of specific events. This topological approach advances computational social science by enabling real-time detection of semantic restructuring during crises, protests, and information shocks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6458\u8981\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5229\u7528\u6301\u7eed\u6027\u540c\u8c03\u68c0\u6d4b\u5a92\u4f53\u53d9\u4e8b\u7ed3\u6784\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u91cd\u5927\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7684\u65b0\u95fb\u62a5\u9053\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4e8b\u4ef6\u5bf9\u516c\u5171\u8bdd\u8bed\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u6839\u672c\u6027\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u79cd\u6570\u5b66\u4e0a\u4e25\u8c28\u3001\u65e0\u9700\u4e8b\u4ef6\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u68c0\u6d4b\u5168\u7403\u4e8b\u4ef6\u5982\u4f55\u91cd\u5851\u516c\u5171\u8bdd\u8bed\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u540d\u8bcd\u77ed\u8bed\u7684\u5171\u73b0\u56fe\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528Vietoris-Rips\u8fc7\u6ee4\u751f\u6210\u6301\u7eed\u6027\u56fe\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97Wasserstein\u8ddd\u79bb\u548c\u6301\u7eed\u6027\u71b5\uff0c\u6355\u6349\u8bed\u4e49\u4e2d\u65ad\u548c\u53d9\u4e8b\u6ce2\u52a8\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u91cd\u5927\u4e8b\u4ef6\u4e0eH0\u548cH1\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7684\u5c16\u9510\u5cf0\u503c\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u53d9\u4e8b\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u7a81\u7136\u91cd\u7ec4\uff1b\u5e76\u53d1\u73b0H0\u53d8\u5316\u901a\u5e38\u5148\u4e8eH1\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u6ede\u540e\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u5b9e\u65f6\u68c0\u6d4b\u8bed\u4e49\u91cd\u6784\uff0c\u4e3a\u8ba1\u7b97\u793e\u4f1a\u79d1\u5b66\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u3001\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u5206\u6790\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "keywords": "\u6301\u7eed\u6027\u540c\u8c03, \u516c\u5171\u8bdd\u8bed, \u53d9\u4e8b\u7ed3\u6784, \u8bed\u4e49\u53d8\u5316, \u8ba1\u7b97\u793e\u4f1a\u79d1\u5b66"}}

We provide a comprehensive theoretical study to show that: (1) The loss landscape of one-layer linear attention models recover the optimal fully-supervised estimator but completely fail to exploit unlabeled data; (2) In contrast, multilayer or looped transformers can effectively leverage unlabeled data by implicitly constructing estimators of the form $\\sum_{i\\ge 0} a_i (X^\\top X)^iX^\\top y$ with $X$ and $y$ denoting features and partially-observed labels (with missing entries set to zero). We characterize the class of polynomials that can be expressed as a function of depth and draw connections to Expectation Maximization, an iterative pseudo-labeling algorithm commonly used in semi-supervised learning. Importantly, the leading polynomial power is exponential in depth, so mild amount of depth/looping suffices.

However, most existing multimodal reinforcement learning approaches remain limited to spatial reasoning within single-image contexts, yet still struggle to generalize to more complex and real-world scenarios involving multi-image positional reasoning, where understanding the relationships across images is crucial. To address this challenge, we propose a general reinforcement learning approach PeRL tailored for interleaved multimodal tasks, and a multi-stage strategy designed to enhance the exploration-exploitation trade-off, thereby improving learning efficiency and task performance. Specifically, we introduce permutation of image sequences to simulate varied positional relationships to explore more spatial and positional diversity.

Predicting abnormal values of not prescribed tests based on the results of performed tests looks intriguing, as it would be possible to make early diagnosis available to everyone.

Combining routine biochemical panels with CBC presents a set of test-value pairs that varies from patient to patient, or, in common settings, a table with missing values. Here we formulate a tabular modeling problem as a set translation problem where the source set comprises pairs of GPT-like label column embedding and its corresponding value while the target set consists of the same type embeddings only. The proposed approach can effectively deal with missing values without implicitly estimating them and bridges the world of LLM with the tabular domain.

We built FAHR-Face, a foundation model trained on >40 million facial images and fine-tuned it for two distinct tasks: biological age estimation (FAHR-FaceAge) and survival risk prediction (FAHR-FaceSurvival).\n  Methods: FAHR-FaceAge underwent a two-stage, age-balanced fine-tuning on 749,935 public images; FAHR-FaceSurvival was fine-tuned on 34,389 photos of cancer patients. Model robustness (cosmetic surgery, makeup, pose, lighting) and independence (saliency mapping) was tested extensively. Both models were clinically tested in two independent cancer patient datasets with survival analyzed by multivariable Cox models and adjusted for clinical prognostic factors.\n  Findings: For age estimation, FAHR-FaceAge had the lowest mean absolute error of 5.1 years on public datasets, outperforming benchmark models and maintaining accuracy across the full human lifespan. In cancer patients, FAHR-FaceAge outperformed a prior facial age estimation model in survival prognostication. FAHR-FaceSurvival demonstrated robust prediction of mortality, and the highest-risk quartile had more than triple the mortality of the lowest (adjusted hazard ratio 3.22; P<0.001). These findings were validated in the independent cohort and both models showed generalizability across age, sex, race and cancer subgroups. The two algorithms provided distinct, complementary prognostic information; saliency mapping revealed each model relied on distinct facial regions. The combination of FAHR-FaceAge and FAHR-FaceSurvival improved prognostic accuracy.\n  Interpretation: A single foundation model can generate inexpensive, scalable facial biomarkers that capture both biological ageing and disease-related mortality risk.

Accurate and stable MD simulations, crucial for evaluating material properties, require training data encompassing both low-energy stable structures and high-energy structures. Conventional knowledge distillation (KD) methods fine-tune a pre-trained NNP as a teacher model to generate training data for a student model. However, in material-specific models, this fine-tuning process increases energy barriers, making it difficult to create training data containing high-energy structures. To address this, we propose a novel KD framework that leverages a non-fine-tuned, off-the-shelf pre-trained NNP as a teacher. Its gentler energy landscape facilitates the exploration of a wider range of structures, including the high-energy structures crucial for stable MD simulations. Our framework employs a two-stage training process: first, the student NNP is trained with a dataset generated by the off-the-shelf teacher; then, it is fine-tuned with a smaller, high-accuracy density functional theory (DFT) dataset. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework by applying it to both organic (polyethylene glycol) and inorganic (L$_{10}$GeP$_{2}$S$_{12}$) materials, achieving comparable or superior accuracy in reproducing physical properties compared to existing methods.

This framework allows us to determine in a principled way whether a specific language model can effectively simulate human opinions, decision-making, and general behaviors represented through multiple-choice options. We applied this framework to a popular language model for simulating people's opinions in various public surveys and found that this model is ill-suited for simulating the tested sub-populations (e.g., across different races, ages, and incomes) for contentious questions. This raises questions about the alignment of this language model with the tested populations, highlighting the need for new practices in using LLMs for social science studies beyond naive simulations of human subjects.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u91cf\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30LLMs\u5728\u591a\u9879\u9009\u62e9\u8c03\u67e5\u4e2d\u6a21\u62df\u4eba\u7c7b\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u504f\u79bb\u7a0b\u5ea6\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u67d0\u4e9b\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u9002\u5408\u6a21\u62df\u7279\u5b9a\u5b50\u7fa4\u4f53\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740LLMs\u5728\u793e\u4f1a\u79d1\u5b66\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u9700\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u6a21\u62df\u4eba\u7c7b\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5047\u8bbe\u68c0\u9a8c\u6784\u5efa\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30LLMs\u6a21\u62df\u4eba\u7c7b\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u504f\u79bb\u7a0b\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u4e89\u8bae\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u5b50\u7fa4\u4f53\u65f6\u4e0d\u9002\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9700\u6539\u8fdbLLMs\u5728\u793e\u4f1a\u79d1\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u7b80\u5355\u6a21\u62df\u4eba\u7c7b\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "keywords": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b,\u793e\u4f1a\u79d1\u5b66,\u5047\u8bbe\u68c0\u9a8c,\u884c\u4e3a\u6a21\u62df"}}

The advantage of these methods is the ability to generate high-resolution samples, which are otherwise unattainable with classical inversion methods or other deep learning-based solutions. However, the iterative and stochastic nature of sampling from diffusion models along with heuristic nature of output control remain limiting factors for their applicability. For instance, an optimal way to include the approximate velocity model into diffusion-based inversion scheme remains unclear, even though it is considered an essential part of FWI pipeline. We address the issue by employing a Schr\u00f6dinger Bridge that interpolates between the distributions of ground truth and smoothed velocity models. To facilitate the learning of nonlinear drifts that transfer samples between distributions we extend the concept of Image-to-Image Schr\u00f6dinger Bridge ($\\text{I}^2\\text{SB}$) to conditional sampling, resulting in a conditional Image-to-Image Schr\u00f6dinger Bridge (c$\\text{I}^2\\text{SB}$) framework. To validate our method, we assess its effectiveness in reconstructing the reference velocity model from its smoothed approximation, coupled with the observed seismic signal of fixed shape. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed solution outperforms our reimplementation of conditional diffusion model suggested in earlier works, while requiring only a few neural function evaluations (NFEs) to achieve sample fidelity superior to that attained with supervised learning-based approach.

However, in the more practical black-box setting where gradients cannot be manipulated during training and only the last model iterate is observed, prior work shows that there is still a large gap between the empirical lower bounds and theoretical upper bounds. Consequently, in this work, we study how incorporating approaches for stronger membership inference attacks (MIA) can improve one-run auditing in the black-box setting.

However, applying DiTs to molecules introduces novel challenges, such as integrating discrete molecular graph information with continuous 3D geometry, handling Euclidean symmetries, and designing conditioning mechanisms that generalize across molecules of varying sizes and structures. We propose DiTMC, a framework that adapts DiTs to address these challenges through a modular architecture that separates the processing of 3D coordinates from conditioning on atomic connectivity. To this end, we introduce two complementary graph-based conditioning strategies that integrate seamlessly with the DiT architecture. These are combined with different attention mechanisms, including both standard non-equivariant and SO(3)-equivariant formulations, enabling flexible control over the trade-off between between accuracy and computational efficiency. Experiments on standard conformer generation benchmarks (GEOM-QM9, -DRUGS, -XL) demonstrate that DiTMC achieves state-of-the-art precision and physical validity. Our results highlight how architectural choices and symmetry priors affect sample quality and efficiency, suggesting promising directions for large-scale generative modeling of molecular structures.

While effective on foundational linguistic operations essential for narrative extraction, such models lack the deeper semantic understanding required to distinguish extracting economic narratives from merely conducting classic tasks like Semantic Role Labeling. Instead of relying on complex model pipelines, we evaluate the benefits of Large Language Models (LLMs) by analyzing a corpus of Wall Street Journal and New York Times newspaper articles about inflation. We apply a rigorous narrative definition and compare GPT-4o outputs to gold-standard narratives produced by expert annotators. Our results suggests that GPT-4o is capable of extracting valid economic narratives in a structured format, but still falls short of expert-level performance when handling complex documents and narratives.

Its effectiveness is significantly influenced by the choice of the underlying ground metric. Traditionally, the ground metric has either been (i) predefined, e.g., as the Euclidean distance, or (ii) learned in a supervised way, by utilizing labeled data to learn a suitable ground metric for enhanced task-specific performance. Yet, predefined metrics typically cannot account for the inherent structure and varying importance of different features in the data, and existing supervised approaches to ground metric learning often do not generalize across multiple classes or are restricted to distributions with shared supports. To address these limitations, we propose a novel approach for learning metrics for arbitrary distributions over a shared metric space. Our method provides a distance between individual points like a global metric, but requires only class labels on a distribution-level for training.

This paper introduces a multi-task music captioning model, SonicVerse, that integrates caption generation with auxiliary music feature detection tasks such as key detection, vocals detection, and more, so as to directly capture both low-level acoustic details as well as high-level musical attributes. The key contribution is a projection-based architecture that transforms audio input into language tokens, while simultaneously detecting music features through dedicated auxiliary heads. The outputs of these heads are also projected into language tokens, to enhance the captioning input. This framework not only produces rich, descriptive captions for short music fragments but also directly enables the generation of detailed time-informed descriptions for longer music pieces, by chaining the outputs using a large-language model. To train the model, we extended the MusicBench dataset by annotating it with music features using MIRFLEX, a modular music feature extractor, resulting in paired audio, captions and music feature data.

Then, we present a novel principle for exploration based on density estimation, a problem well-known to be challenging in practice. To overcome this issue and render this method truly scalable, we leverage a fundamental connection between the entropy of the density induced by a diffusion model and its score function. Building on this, we develop an algorithm based on mirror descent that solves the exploration problem as sequential fine-tuning of a pre-trained diffusion model.

In this paper, we present video-SALMONN 2, an advanced audio-visual large language model (LLM) with low-rank adaptation (LoRA) designed for enhanced video (with paired audio) captioning through directed preference optimisation (DPO). We propose new metrics to evaluate the completeness and accuracy of video descriptions, which are optimised using DPO. To further improve training, we propose a novel multi-round DPO (MrDPO) approach, which involves periodically updating the DPO reference model, merging and re-initialising the LoRA module as a proxy for parameter updates after each training round (1,000 steps), and incorporating guidance from ground-truth video captions to stabilise the process. Experimental results show that MrDPO significantly enhances video-SALMONN 2's captioning accuracy, reducing the captioning error rates by 28\\%. The final video-SALMONN 2 model, with just 7 billion parameters, surpasses leading models such as GPT-4o and Gemini-1.5-Pro in video captioning tasks, while maintaining highly competitive performance to the state-of-the-art on widely used video question-answering benchmarks among models of similar size.

Given a highly contagious disease, a natural question is how to best vaccinate individuals to minimize the disease's extinction time. While previous works showed that the problem of optimal vaccination is closely linked to the NP-hard Spectral Radius Minimization (SRM) problem, they assumed that the graph is known, which is often not the case in practice. In this work, we consider the problem of minimizing the extinction time of an outbreak modeled by an SIS model where the graph on which the disease spreads is unknown and only the infection states of the vertices are observed. To this end, we split the problem into two: learning the graph and determining effective vaccination strategies. We propose a novel inclusion-exclusion-based learning algorithm and, unlike previous approaches, establish its sample complexity for graph recovery.

However, in-home meal assistance remains challenging due to the diversity of activities (e.g., eating, drinking, mouth wiping), contexts (e.g., socializing, watching TV), food items, and user preferences that arise during deployment. In this work, we propose FEAST, a flexible mealtime-assistance system that can be personalized in-the-wild to meet the unique needs of individual care recipients. Developed in collaboration with two community researchers and informed by a formative study with a diverse group of care recipients, our system is guided by three key tenets for in-the-wild personalization: adaptability, transparency, and safety. FEAST embodies these principles through: (i) modular hardware that enables switching between assisted feeding, drinking, and mouth-wiping, (ii) diverse interaction methods, including a web interface, head gestures, and physical buttons, to accommodate diverse functional abilities and preferences, and (iii) parameterized behavior trees that can be safely and transparently adapted using a large language model. We evaluate our system based on the personalization requirements identified in our formative study, demonstrating that FEAST offers a wide range of transparent and safe adaptations and outperforms a state-of-the-art baseline limited to fixed customizations. To demonstrate real-world applicability, we conduct an in-home user study with two care recipients (who are community researchers), feeding them three meals each across three diverse scenarios. We further assess FEAST's ecological validity by evaluating with an Occupational Therapist previously unfamiliar with the system. In all cases, users successfully personalize FEAST to meet their individual needs and preferences.

While powerful, their complexity poses a major challenge to trustworthiness, particularly due to a lack of transparency. Explainable AI (XAI) addresses this issue by providing human-understandable explanations of model behavior. However, to ensure their usefulness and trustworthiness, such explanations must be rigorously evaluated. Despite the growing number of XAI methods, the field lacks standardized evaluation protocols and consensus on appropriate metrics. To address this gap, we conduct a systematic literature review following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines and introduce a unified framework for the eValuation of XAI (VXAI). We identify 362 relevant publications and aggregate their contributions into 41 functionally similar metric groups. In addition, we propose a three-dimensional categorization scheme spanning explanation type, evaluation contextuality, and explanation quality desiderata.

Experimental results show that our proposed directional-SpeechLlama effectively captures the relationship between textual cues and spatial audio, yielding strong performance in both speech recognition and source localization tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86directional-SpeechLlama\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u5229\u7528\u667a\u80fd\u773c\u955c\u9ea6\u514b\u98ce\u9635\u5217\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b9a\u5411\u8bed\u97f3\u8bc6\u522b\u3001\u58f0\u6e90\u5b9a\u4f4d\u548c\u65c1\u542c\u8005\u5e72\u6270\u6291\u5236\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u5728\u97f3\u9891\u7f16\u7801\u4e0b\u7684\u8bed\u97f3\u8bc6\u522b\u80fd\u529b\u5df2\u88ab\u8bc1\u660e\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5bf9\u591a\u901a\u9053\u97f3\u9891\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ebf\u7d22\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u5c1a\u5f85\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u5173\u952e\u6280\u672f\uff1a\u5e8f\u5217\u5316\u5b9a\u5411\u8f93\u51fa\u8bad\u7ec3\uff08S-DOT\uff09\u548c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u65b9\u5411\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\uff08CDDA\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cdirectional-SpeechLlama\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u6355\u6349\u6587\u672c\u7ebf\u7d22\u4e0e\u7a7a\u95f4\u97f3\u9891\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5728\u8bed\u97f3\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u58f0\u6e90\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u591a\u901a\u9053\u97f3\u9891\u5904\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86LLM\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u97f3\u9891\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "keywords": "\u8bed\u97f3\u8bc6\u522b,\u591a\u901a\u9053\u97f3\u9891,\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ebf\u7d22,\u5b9a\u5411\u8bad\u7ec3,\u58f0\u6e90\u5b9a\u4f4d"}}

Current feature description methods face two critical challenges: limited robustness and the flawed assumption that each neuron encodes only a single concept (monosemanticity), despite growing evidence that neurons are often polysemantic. This assumption restricts the expressiveness of feature descriptions and limits their ability to capture the full range of behaviors encoded in model internals. To address this, we introduce Polysemantic FeatuRe Identification and Scoring Method (PRISM), a novel framework that captures the inherent complexity of neural network features. Unlike prior approaches that assign a single description per feature, PRISM provides more nuanced descriptions for both polysemantic and monosemantic features. We apply PRISM to language models and, through extensive benchmarking against existing methods, demonstrate that our approach produces more accurate and faithful feature descriptions, improving both overall description quality (via a description score) and the ability to capture distinct concepts when polysemanticity is present (via a polysemanticity score).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86PRISM\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u8bc4\u5206\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u590d\u6742\u8bed\u4e49\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u5355\u4e49\u6027\u5047\u8bbe\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7279\u5f81\u63cf\u8ff0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5047\u8bbe\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u4ec5\u7f16\u7801\u5355\u4e00\u6982\u5ff5\uff08\u5355\u4e49\u6027\uff09\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u591a\u4e49\u6027\u7684\u5b58\u5728\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u63cf\u8ff0\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u8868\u73b0\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86PRISM\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u4e3a\u591a\u4e49\u6027\u548c\u5355\u4e49\u6027\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u7ec6\u81f4\u7684\u63cf\u8ff0\u3002", "result": "PRISM\u5728\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u63cf\u8ff0\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u591a\u4e49\u6027\u6355\u6349\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "PRISM\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7279\u5f81\u63cf\u8ff0\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u5904\u7406\u591a\u4e49\u6027\u7279\u5f81\u65f6\u3002", "keywords": "\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc, \u7279\u5f81\u63cf\u8ff0, \u591a\u4e49\u6027, PRISM\u6846\u67b6, \u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b"}}

However, their widespread adoption raises significant safety concerns, particularly in responding to socially harmful questions. Despite substantial efforts to improve model safety through alignment, aligned models can still have their safety protections undermined by subsequent fine-tuning - even when the additional training data appears benign. In this paper, we empirically demonstrate that this vulnerability stems from the sensitivity of safety-critical low-rank subspaces in LLM parameters to fine-tuning. Building on this insight, we propose a novel training-free method, termed Low-Rank Extrapolation (LoX), to enhance safety robustness by extrapolating the safety subspace of an aligned LLM. Our experimental results confirm the effectiveness of LoX, demonstrating significant improvements in robustness against both benign and malicious fine-tuning attacks while preserving the model's adaptability to new tasks. For instance, LoX leads to 11% to 54% absolute reductions in attack success rates (ASR) facing benign or malicious fine-tuning attacks. By investigating the ASR landscape of parameters, we attribute the success of LoX to that the extrapolation moves LLM parameters to a flatter zone, thereby less sensitive to perturbations.

Current methods in this line posit that 1) normal nodes share a similar level of homophily and 2) the labeled normal nodes can well represent the homophily patterns in the normal class. However, this assumption often does not hold well since normal nodes in a graph can exhibit diverse homophily in real-world GAD datasets. In this paper, we propose RHO, namely Robust Homophily Learning, to adaptively learn such homophily patterns. RHO consists of two novel modules, adaptive frequency response filters (AdaFreq) and graph normality alignment (GNA). AdaFreq learns a set of adaptive spectral filters that capture different frequency components of the labeled normal nodes with varying homophily in the channel-wise and cross-channel views of node attributes. GNA is introduced to enforce consistency between the channel-wise and cross-channel homophily representations to robustify the normality learned by the filters in the two views. Experiments on eight real-world GAD datasets show that RHO can effectively learn varying, often under-represented, homophily in the small normal node set and substantially outperforms state-of-the-art competing methods.

We present AutoRule, a fully automated method for extracting rules from preference feedback and formulating them into rule-based rewards. AutoRule extraction operates in three stages: it leverages a reasoning model to interpret user preferences, identifies candidate rules from the reasoning chain of these interpretations, and synthesizes them into a unified rule set. Leveraging the finalized rule set, we employ language-model verifiers to compute the fraction of rules satisfied by each output, using this metric as an auxiliary reward alongside the learned reward model during policy optimization. Training a Llama-3-8B model with AutoRule results in a 28.6\\% relative improvement in length-controlled win rate on AlpacaEval2.0, and a 6.1\\% relative gain in second-turn performance on a held-out MT-Bench subset, compared to a GRPO baseline trained with the same learned reward model but without the rule-based auxiliary reward. Our analysis confirms that the extracted rules exhibit good agreement with dataset preference. We find that AutoRule demonstrates reduced reward hacking compared to a learned reward model when run over two episodes.

Ideally, training an SAE would yield latents that are both sparse and semantically meaningful. However, many SAE latents activate frequently (i.e., are \\emph{dense}), raising concerns that they may be undesirable artifacts of the training procedure. In this work, we systematically investigate the geometry, function, and origin of dense latents and show that they are not only persistent but often reflect meaningful model representations. We first demonstrate that dense latents tend to form antipodal pairs that reconstruct specific directions in the residual stream, and that ablating their subspace suppresses the emergence of new dense features in retrained SAEs -- suggesting that high density features are an intrinsic property of the residual space. We then introduce a taxonomy of dense latents, identifying classes tied to position tracking, context binding, entropy regulation, letter-specific output signals, part-of-speech, and principal component reconstruction. Finally, we analyze how these features evolve across layers, revealing a shift from structural features in early layers, to semantic features in mid layers, and finally to output-oriented signals in the last layers of the model.

While generative AI can produce visually appealing images they often lack actionable data for designers In this work, we propose a novel pipeline that integrates DALL-E 3 with a materials dataset to enrich AI-generated designs with sustainability metrics and material usage insights. After the model generates an interior design image, a post-processing module identifies the top ten materials present and pairs them with carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) values from a general materials dictionary. This approach allows designers to immediately evaluate environmental impacts and refine prompts accordingly. We evaluate the system through three user tests: (1) no mention of sustainability to the user prior to the prompting process with generative AI, (2) sustainability goals communicated to the user before prompting, and (3) sustainability goals communicated along with quantitative CO2e data included in the generative AI outputs. Our qualitative and quantitative analyses reveal that the introduction of sustainability metrics in the third test leads to more informed design decisions, however, it can also trigger decision fatigue and lower overall satisfaction. Nevertheless, the majority of participants reported incorporating sustainability principles into their workflows in the third test, underscoring the potential of integrated metrics to guide more ecologically responsible practices.

Such linear predictors can model non-linear relationships between features by adding interaction terms corresponding to the products of all pairs of features. We consider the problem of accurately estimating coefficients for interaction terms in linear predictors. We hypothesize that the coefficients for different interaction terms have an approximate low-dimensional structure and represent each feature by a latent vector in a low-dimensional space. This low-dimensional representation can be viewed as a structured regularization approach that further mitigates overfitting in high-dimensional settings beyond standard regularizers such as the lasso and elastic net. We demonstrate that our approach, called LIT-LVM, achieves superior prediction accuracy compared to elastic net and factorization machines on a wide variety of simulated and real data, particularly when the number of interaction terms is high compared to the number of samples.

However, these explanations are highly non-robust: small, imperceptible input perturbations can drastically alter the attribution map while maintaining the same prediction. This vulnerability undermines their trustworthiness and calls for rigorous robustness guarantees of pixel-level attribution scores. We introduce the first certification framework that guarantees pixel-level robustness for any black-box attribution method using randomized smoothing. By sparsifying and smoothing attribution maps, we reformulate the task as a segmentation problem and certify each pixel's importance against $\\ell_2$-bounded perturbations. We further propose three evaluation metrics to assess certified robustness, localization, and faithfulness. An extensive evaluation of 12 attribution methods across 5 ImageNet models shows that our certified attributions are robust, interpretable, and faithful, enabling reliable use in downstream tasks.

Bronstein"], "title": "Over-squashing in Spatiotemporal Graph Neural Networks", "categories": ["cs.LG", "cs.AI"], "comment": null, "summary": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success across various domains. However, recent theoretical advances have identified fundamental limitations in their information propagation capabilities, such as over-squashing, where distant nodes fail to effectively exchange information. While extensively studied in static contexts, this issue remains unexplored in Spatiotemporal GNNs (STGNNs), which process sequences associated with graph nodes. Nonetheless, the temporal dimension amplifies this challenge by increasing the information that must be propagated. In this work, we formalize the spatiotemporal over-squashing problem and demonstrate its distinct characteristics compared to the static case.

However, models may still rely on memorized training data, bypass the retrieved evidence, and produce contaminated outputs. We introduce Retrieval-Path Contamination Scoring (RePCS), a diagnostic method that detects such behavior without requiring model access or retraining. RePCS compares two inference paths: (i) a parametric path using only the query, and (ii) a retrieval-augmented path using both the query and retrieved context by computing the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between their output distributions. A low divergence suggests that the retrieved context had minimal impact, indicating potential memorization. This procedure is model-agnostic, requires no gradient or internal state access, and adds only a single additional forward pass. We further derive PAC-style guarantees that link the KL threshold to user-defined false positive and false negative rates. On the Prompt-WNQA benchmark, RePCS achieves a ROC-AUC of 0.918. This result outperforms the strongest prior method by 6.5 percentage points while keeping latency overhead below 4.7% on an NVIDIA T4 GPU.

To address this gap, we developed Carey, a GPT-4o-based chatbot designed to provide informational and emotional support to AD/ADRD caregivers. Using Carey as a technology probe, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 16 family caregivers following scenario-driven interactions grounded in common caregiving stressors. Through inductive coding and reflexive thematic analysis, we surface a systemic understanding of caregiver needs and expectations across six themes -- on-demand information access, emotional support, safe space for disclosure, crisis management, personalization, and data privacy. For each of these themes, we also identified the nuanced tensions in the caregivers' desires and concerns.

Further, we build a formal framework around observations of \\textit{computational agents} and show that learning computable functions from policy trajectories reduces to learning rational functions from input and output, thereby revealing interesting connections to finite-state transducer inference. On the negative side, we show that computable or polynomial-mass characteristic sets cannot exist for the class of linear-time computable functions even for policy-trajectory observations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u6269\u5c55\u4e86Gold\u7684\u5f52\u7eb3\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u8ba1\u7b97\u89c2\u6d4b\u548c\u53d7\u9650\u8f93\u5165\u6e90\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u6781\u9650\u5b66\u4e60\u53ef\u8ba1\u7b97\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8f93\u5165\u8f93\u51fa\u89c2\u6d4b\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u5b66\u4e60\u4e00\u822c\u9012\u5f52\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u4f46\u52a0\u5165\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\u6216\u8fd1\u4f3c\u65f6\u95f4\u8fb9\u754c\u89c2\u6d4b\u53ef\u4ee5\u514b\u670d\u8fd9\u4e00\u969c\u788d\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u5728\u66f4\u73b0\u5b9e\u7684\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\uff08\u5982\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u548c\u53d7\u9650\u8f93\u5165\u6e90\uff09\u5b66\u4e60\u53ef\u8ba1\u7b97\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u5f52\u7eb3\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u65f6\u95f4\u8fb9\u754c\u89c2\u6d4b\u548c\u7b56\u7565\u8f68\u8ff9\u89c2\u6d4b\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u5206\u6790\u8ba1\u7b97\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u89c2\u6d4b\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u6709\u9650\u72b6\u6001\u8f6c\u6362\u5668\u63a8\u65ad\u76f8\u8054\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "\u8f93\u5165\u8f93\u51fa\u89c2\u6d4b\u65e0\u6cd5\u5b66\u4e60\u4e00\u822c\u9012\u5f52\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u4f46\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\u6216\u65f6\u95f4\u8fb9\u754c\u89c2\u6d4b\u53ef\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\uff1b\u7b56\u7565\u8f68\u8ff9\u89c2\u6d4b\u5c06\u95ee\u9898\u7b80\u5316\u4e3a\u8f93\u5165\u8f93\u51fa\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8ba1\u7b97\u89c2\u6d4b\u548c\u53d7\u9650\u8f93\u5165\u6e90\u5bf9\u5b66\u4e60\u53ef\u8ba1\u7b97\u51fd\u6570\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u4e0e\u6709\u9650\u72b6\u6001\u8f6c\u6362\u5668\u63a8\u65ad\u7684\u8054\u7cfb\uff0c\u4f46\u7ebf\u6027\u65f6\u95f4\u53ef\u8ba1\u7b97\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u96c6\u4e0d\u5b58\u5728\u3002", "keywords": "\u53ef\u8ba1\u7b97\u51fd\u6570, \u5f52\u7eb3\u63a8\u7406, \u8ba1\u7b97\u89c2\u6d4b, \u7b56\u7565\u8f68\u8ff9, \u6709\u9650\u72b6\u6001\u8f6c\u6362\u5668"}}

Bike-sharing systems (BSS) can bridge these equity gaps by providing affordable first- and last-mile connections. However, strategically expanding BSS into underserved neighborhoods is difficult due to uncertain bike-sharing demand at newly planned (\"cold-start\") station locations and limitations in traditional accessibility metrics that may overlook realistic bike usage potential. We introduce Transit for All (TFA), a spatial computing framework designed to guide the equitable expansion of BSS through three components: (1) spatially-informed bike-sharing demand prediction at cold-start stations using region representation learning that integrates multimodal geospatial data, (2) comprehensive transit accessibility assessment leveraging our novel weighted Public Transport Accessibility Level (wPTAL) by combining predicted bike-sharing demand with conventional transit accessibility metrics, and (3) strategic recommendations for new bike station placements that consider potential ridership and equity enhancement. Using NYC as a case study, we identify transit accessibility gaps that disproportionately impact low-income and minority communities in historically underserved neighborhoods. Our results show that strategically placing new stations guided by wPTAL notably reduces disparities in transit access related to economic and demographic factors. From our study, we demonstrate that TFA provides practical guidance for urban planners to promote equitable transit and enhance the quality of life in underserved urban communities.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a\u201cTransit for All (TFA)\u201d\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u8ba1\u7b97\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u9884\u6d4b\u9700\u6c42\u3001\u8bc4\u4f30\u53ef\u8bbf\u95ee\u6027\u548c\u6218\u7565\u89c4\u5212\uff0c\u516c\u5e73\u6269\u5c55\u5171\u4eab\u5355\u8f66\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4f4e\u6536\u5165\u548c\u5c11\u6570\u65cf\u88d4\u793e\u533a\u7684\u4ea4\u901a\u4e0d\u5e73\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u4eba\u53e3\u5bc6\u96c6\u7684\u57ce\u5e02\uff08\u5982\u7ebd\u7ea6\u5e02\uff09\uff0c\u4f4e\u6536\u5165\u548c\u5c11\u6570\u65cf\u88d4\u793e\u533a\u5e38\u9762\u4e34\u516c\u5171\u4ea4\u901a\u4e0d\u4fbf\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002\u5171\u4eab\u5355\u8f66\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08BSS\uff09\u53ef\u4ee5\u5f25\u5408\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4e0d\u5e73\u7b49\uff0c\u4f46\u6269\u5c55\u81f3\u670d\u52a1\u4e0d\u8db3\u793e\u533a\u65f6\u9762\u4e34\u9700\u6c42\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u548c\u4f20\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u3002", "method": "TFA\u6846\u67b6\u5305\u62ec\u4e09\u90e8\u5206\uff1a1) \u57fa\u4e8e\u533a\u57df\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5171\u4eab\u5355\u8f66\u9700\u6c42\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c2) \u7ed3\u5408\u9884\u6d4b\u9700\u6c42\u548c\u4f20\u7edf\u6307\u6807\u7684\u53ef\u8bbf\u95ee\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\uff08wPTAL\uff09\uff0c3) \u6218\u7565\u89c4\u5212\u65b0\u7ad9\u70b9\uff0c\u8003\u8651\u9700\u6c42\u4e0e\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u7ebd\u7ea6\u5e02\u7684\u6848\u4f8b\u4e2d\uff0cTFA\u6846\u67b6\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u7ecf\u6d4e\u53ca\u4eba\u53e3\u56e0\u7d20\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u4ea4\u901a\u4e0d\u5e73\u7b49\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u80fd\u4e3a\u57ce\u5e02\u89c4\u5212\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u7528\u6307\u5bfc\u3002", "conclusion": "TFA\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u63d0\u5347\u670d\u52a1\u4e0d\u8db3\u793e\u533a\u7684\u4ea4\u901a\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u548c\u751f\u6d3b\u8d28\u91cf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "keywords": "\u4ea4\u901a\u516c\u5e73\u6027\uff0c\u5171\u4eab\u5355\u8f66\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u7a7a\u95f4\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u53ef\u8bbf\u95ee\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u9700\u6c42\u9884\u6d4b"}}

This lack of interpretability hampers our ability to understand the impact of temporal variations - caused by environmental dynamics - and to adapt models for long-term reliability. To address this, we introduce LogNet, a novel logic gate-based framework designed to interpret and enhance DL-based indoor localization. LogNet enables transparent reasoning by identifying which access points (APs) are most influential for each reference point (RP) and reveals how environmental noise disrupts DL-driven localization decisions. This interpretability allows us to trace and diagnose model failures and adapt DL systems for more stable long-term deployments. Evaluations across multiple real-world building floorplans and over two years of temporal variation show that LogNet not only interprets the internal behavior of DL models but also improves performance-achieving up to 1.1x to 2.8x lower localization error, 3.4x to 43.3x smaller model size, and 1.5x to 3.6x lower latency compared to prior DL-based models.", "AI": {"tldr": "LogNet\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u903b\u8f91\u95e8\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u91ca\u548c\u589e\u5f3a\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5ba4\u5185\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u957f\u671f\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u5ba4\u5185\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6a21\u578b\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5bf9\u5176\u9884\u6d4b\u8fc7\u7a0b\u548c\u5e94\u5bf9\u73af\u5883\u566a\u58f0\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u900f\u660e\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faLogNet\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u903b\u8f91\u95e8\u7ed3\u6784\u8bc6\u522b\u6700\u5177\u5f71\u54cd\u529b\u7684\u63a5\u5165\u70b9\uff08APs\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u73af\u5883\u566a\u58f0\u5bf9\u5b9a\u4f4d\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "LogNet\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u5efa\u7b51\u5e73\u9762\u56fe\u548c\u4e24\u5e74\u65f6\u95f4\u53d8\u5316\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u5b9a\u4f4d\u8bef\u5dee\u964d\u4f4e1.1x\u81f32.8x\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u5927\u5c0f\u7f29\u5c0f3.4x\u81f343.3x\uff0c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u964d\u4f4e1.5x\u81f33.6x\u3002", "conclusion": "LogNet\u4e0d\u4ec5\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u8fd8\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u957f\u671f\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "keywords": "\u5ba4\u5185\u5b9a\u4f4d, \u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60, \u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027, LogNet, \u903b\u8f91\u95e8"}}

However, current hyper-parameters tuning methods for warm-start particles swarm optimization with cross and mutation (WS-PSO-CM) algortihm for radio map-enabled unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) trajectory and communication are primarily heuristic-based, exhibiting low levels of automation and unsatisfactory performance. In this paper, we design an large language model (LLM) agent for automatic hyper-parameters-tuning, where an iterative framework and model context protocol (MCP) are applied. In particular, the LLM agent is first setup via a profile, which specifies the mission, background, and output format. Then, the LLM agent is driven by the prompt requirement, and iteratively invokes WS-PSO-CM algorithm for exploration.

We introduce DP-GRAPE (Gradient RAndom ProjEction), a DP training method that significantly reduces memory usage while maintaining utility on par with first-order DP approaches. Rather than directly applying DP to GaLore, DP-GRAPE introduces three key modifications: (1) gradients are privatized after projection, (2) random Gaussian matrices replace SVD-based subspaces, and (3) projection is applied during backpropagation. These contributions eliminate the need for costly SVD computations, enable substantial memory savings, and lead to improved utility. Despite operating in lower-dimensional subspaces, our theoretical analysis shows that DP-GRAPE achieves a privacy-utility trade-off comparable to DP-SGD. Our extensive empirical experiments show that DP-GRAPE can reduce the memory footprint of DP training without sacrificing accuracy or training time. In particular, DP-GRAPE reduces memory usage by over 63% when pre-training Vision Transformers and over 70% when fine-tuning RoBERTa-Large as compared to DP-Adam, while achieving similar performance.

However, training robust BrainAGE models requires large datasets, often restricted by privacy concerns. This study evaluates the performance of federated learning (FL) for BrainAGE estimation in ischemic stroke patients treated with mechanical thrombectomy, and investigates its association with clinical phenotypes and functional outcomes.\n  $\\textbf{Methods:}$ We used FLAIR brain images from 1674 stroke patients across 16 hospital centers. We implemented standard machine learning and deep learning models for BrainAGE estimates under three data management strategies: centralized learning (pooled data), FL (local training at each site), and single-site learning. We reported prediction errors and examined associations between BrainAGE and vascular risk factors (e.g., diabetes mellitus, hypertension, smoking), as well as functional outcomes at three months post-stroke. Logistic regression evaluated BrainAGE's predictive value for these outcomes, adjusting for age, sex, vascular risk factors, stroke severity, time between MRI and arterial puncture, prior intravenous thrombolysis, and recanalisation outcome.\n  $\\textbf{Results:}$ While centralized learning yielded the most accurate predictions, FL consistently outperformed single-site models.

This paper focuses on a limitation of the Advantage-Weighted Regression family (AWRs), i.e., the potential for learning over-conservative policies due to data corruption, specifically the poor explorations in suboptimal offline data. We study it from two perspectives: (1) how poor explorations impact the theoretically optimal policy based on KL divergence, and (2) how such poor explorations affect the approximation of the theoretically optimal policy. We prove that such over-conservatism is mainly caused by the sensitivity of the loss function for policy optimization to poor explorations, and the proportion of poor explorations in offline datasets. To address this concern, we propose Corruption-Averse Advantage-Weighted Regression (CAWR), which incorporates a set of robust loss functions during policy optimization and an advantage-based prioritized experience replay method to filter out poor explorations.

Thanks to the success of deep learning methods in recent years in the computer vision domain, Industry 4.0 and 5.0 applications, such as defect classification, have achieved remarkable success. In particular, Domain Adaptation (DA) has proven highly effective since it focuses on using the knowledge learned on a (source) domain to adapt and perform effectively on a different but related (target) domain. By improving robustness and scalability, DA minimizes the need for extensive manual re-labeling or re-training of models. This not only reduces computational and resource costs but also allows human experts to focus on high-value tasks. Therefore, we tested the efficacy of DA techniques in semi-supervised and unsupervised settings within the context of the semiconductor field.

Existing approaches typically assume that IMU sensors are tightly attached to the human body. However, this assumption often does not hold in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we present a new task of full-body human pose estimation using sparse, loosely attached IMU sensors. To solve this task, we simulate IMU recordings from an existing garment-aware human motion dataset. We developed transformer-based diffusion models to synthesize loose IMU data and estimate human poses based on this challenging loose IMU data. In addition, we show that incorporating garment-related parameters while training the model on simulated loose data effectively maintains expressiveness and enhances the ability to capture variations introduced by looser or tighter garments.

PresPM holds significant promise for organizations seeking enhanced operational performance. However, the current literature faces two key limitations: a lack of extensive comparisons between techniques and insufficient evaluation approaches. To address these gaps, we introduce SimBank: a simulator designed for accurate benchmarking of PresPM methods. Modeled after a bank's loan application process, SimBank enables extensive comparisons of both online and offline PresPM methods. It incorporates a variety of intervention optimization problems with differing levels of complexity and supports experiments on key causal machine learning challenges, such as assessing a method's robustness to confounding in data. SimBank additionally offers a comprehensive evaluation capability: for each test case, it can generate the true outcome under each intervention action, which is not possible using recorded datasets. The simulator incorporates parallel activities and loops, drawing from common logs to generate cases that closely resemble real-life process instances.

However, the limited spatial resolution in 360\u00b0 videos does not allow for each degree of view to be represented with adequate pixels, limiting the visual quality offered in the immersive experience. Deep learning Video Super-Resolution (VSR) techniques used for conventional videos could provide a promising software-based solution; however, these techniques do not tackle the distortion present in equirectangular projections of 360\u00b0 video signals. An additional obstacle is the limited availability of 360\u00b0 video datasets for study. To address these issues, this paper creates a novel 360\u00b0 Video Dataset (360VDS) with a study of the extensibility of conventional VSR models to 360\u00b0 videos. This paper further proposes a novel deep learning model for 360\u00b0 Video Super-Resolution (360\u00b0 VSR), called Spherical Signal Super-resolution with a Proportioned Optimisation (S3PO). S3PO adopts recurrent modelling with an attention mechanism, unbound from conventional VSR techniques like alignment. With a purpose-built feature extractor and a novel loss function addressing spherical distortion, S3PO outperforms most state-of-the-art conventional VSR models and 360\u00b0~specific super-resolution models on 360\u00b0 video datasets. A step-wise ablation study is presented to understand and demonstrate the impact of the chosen architectural sub-components, targeted training and optimisation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e360\u00b0\u89c6\u9891\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7684\u65b0\u6a21\u578bS3PO\uff0c\u5e76\u521b\u5efa\u4e86\u65b0\u6570\u636e\u96c6360VDS\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edfVSR\u6a21\u578b\u5728360\u00b0\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u7684\u5931\u771f\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "360\u00b0\u89c6\u9891\u5728VR\u4e2d\u5e94\u7528\u5e7f\u6cdb\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u89c6\u89c9\u8d28\u91cf\u3002\u4f20\u7edfVSR\u6280\u672f\u65e0\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3360\u00b0\u89c6\u9891\u7684\u5931\u771f\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e14\u76f8\u5173\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6709\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faS3PO\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5faa\u73af\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5b9a\u5236\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u5668\u548c\u65b0\u578b\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u7403\u5f62\u5931\u771f\u5904\u7406\u3002\u5e76\u521b\u5efa360VDS\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "result": "S3PO\u5728360\u00b0\u89c6\u9891\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edfVSR\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u4e13\u7528\u4e8e360\u00b0\u7684\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u9010\u6b65\u6d88\u878d\u7814\u7a76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5404\u7ec4\u4ef6\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "S3PO\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86360\u00b0\u89c6\u9891\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7684\u5931\u771f\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "keywords": "360\u00b0\u89c6\u9891, \u89c6\u9891\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387, VR, \u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60, S3PO"}}

Recently, single-use endoscopes equipped with an ultra-compact analogue image sensor measuring less than 1mm x 1mm bring revolutionary advancements to medical diagnosis. They reduce the structural redundancy and large capital expenditures associated with reusable devices, eliminate the risk of patient infections caused by inadequate disinfection, and alleviate patient suffering. However, the limited photosensitive area results in reduced photon capture per pixel, requiring higher photon sensitivity settings to maintain adequate brightness. In high-contrast medical imaging scenarios, the small-sized sensor exhibits a constrained dynamic range, making it difficult to simultaneously capture details in both highlights and shadows, and additional localized digital gain is required to compensate. Moreover, the simplified circuit design and analog signal transmission introduce additional noise sources. These factors collectively contribute to significant noise issues in processed endoscopic images. In this work, we developed a comprehensive noise model for analog image sensors in medical endoscopes, addressing three primary noise types: fixed-pattern noise, periodic banding noise, and mixed Poisson-Gaussian noise. Building on this analysis, we propose a hybrid denoising system that synergistically combines traditional image processing algorithms with advanced learning-based techniques for captured raw frames from sensors. Experiments demonstrate that our approach effectively reduces image noise without fine detail loss or color distortion, while achieving real-time performance on FPGA platforms and an average PSNR improvement from 21.16 to 33.05 on our test dataset.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u9488\u5bf9\u5c0f\u578b\u6a21\u62df\u56fe\u50cf\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u566a\u58f0\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6df7\u5408\u53bb\u566a\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5185\u7aa5\u955c\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u5355\u6b21\u4f7f\u7528\u5185\u7aa5\u955c\u56e0\u5176\u8d85\u7d27\u51d1\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5728\u533b\u7597\u8bca\u65ad\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u9769\u547d\u6027\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u4f46\u5c0f\u5c3a\u5bf8\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u5bfc\u81f4\u7167\u7247\u611f\u5149\u9762\u79ef\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u663e\u8457\u566a\u58f0\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u89e3\u51b3\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u9488\u5bf9\u6a21\u62df\u56fe\u50cf\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7ed3\u5408\u4f20\u7edf\u56fe\u50cf\u5904\u7406\u548c\u5b66\u4e60\u6280\u672f\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u53bb\u566a\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u4e0d\u635f\u5931\u7ec6\u8282\u6216\u8272\u5f69\u5931\u771f\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u6709\u6548\u964d\u566a\uff0cPSNR\u4ece21.16\u63d0\u5347\u81f333.05\uff0c\u5e76\u5728FPGA\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b9e\u65f6\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u53bb\u566a\u7cfb\u7edf\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u533b\u7597\u5185\u7aa5\u955c\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002", "keywords": "\u5185\u7aa5\u955c,\u566a\u58f0\u6a21\u578b,\u53bb\u566a\u7cfb\u7edf,\u56fe\u50cf\u5904\u7406,FPGA"}}

However, most existing approaches rely on RGB-D sensors or monocular views, which suffer from narrow fields of view, occlusion sensitivity, and limited depth perception-especially in large-scale or outdoor environments. These limitations often restrict the system to observing only partial views of objects from limited perspectives, leading to inaccurate object modeling and unreliable data association. In this work, we propose MCOO-SLAM, a novel Multi-Camera Omnidirectional Object SLAM system that fully leverages surround-view camera configurations to achieve robust, consistent, and semantically enriched mapping in complex outdoor scenarios. Our approach integrates point features and object-level landmarks enhanced with open-vocabulary semantics. A semantic-geometric-temporal fusion strategy is introduced for robust object association across multiple views, leading to improved consistency and accurate object modeling, and an omnidirectional loop closure module is designed to enable viewpoint-invariant place recognition using scene-level descriptors. Furthermore, the constructed map is abstracted into a hierarchical 3D scene graph to support downstream reasoning tasks. Extensive experiments in real-world demonstrate that MCOO-SLAM achieves accurate localization and scalable object-level mapping with improved robustness to occlusion, pose variation, and environmental complexity.", "AI": {"tldr": "MCOO-SLAM\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u591a\u76f8\u673a\u5168\u5411\u7269\u4f53SLAM\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u73af\u7ed5\u89c6\u56fe\u76f8\u673a\u914d\u7f6e\u5728\u590d\u6742\u6237\u5916\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u9c81\u68d2\u3001\u4e00\u81f4\u4e14\u8bed\u4e49\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u5730\u56fe\u6784\u5efa\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfSLAM\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56RGB-D\u6216\u5355\u76ee\u89c6\u56fe\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u89c6\u91ce\u72ed\u7a84\u3001\u906e\u6321\u654f\u611f\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u611f\u77e5\u6709\u9650\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u6237\u5916\u6216\u5927\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u70b9\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u5bf9\u8c61\u7ea7\u5730\u6807\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u8bed\u4e49-\u51e0\u4f55-\u65f6\u5e8f\u878d\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u5bf9\u8c61\u5173\u8054\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5168\u5411\u95ed\u73af\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u5206\u5c423D\u573a\u666f\u56fe\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660eMCOO-SLAM\u5728\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u5730\u56fe\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4e14\u5bf9\u906e\u6321\u3001\u59ff\u6001\u53d8\u5316\u548c\u73af\u5883\u590d\u6742\u6027\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u5f3a\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "MCOO-SLAM\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684SLAM\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "keywords": "SLAM, \u591a\u76f8\u673a, \u5168\u5411\u611f\u77e5, \u8bed\u4e49\u5730\u56fe, \u573a\u666f\u56fe"}}

This study investigates whether transformer models can retain precision amid such heterogeneity. We compare the performance of UNETR and SwinUNETR in prostate gland segmentation against our previous 3D UNet model [1], based on 546 MRI (T2weighted) volumes annotated by two independent experts. Three training strategies were analyzed: single cohort dataset, 5 fold cross validated mixed cohort, and gland size based dataset. Hyperparameters were tuned by Optuna. The test set, from an independent population of readers, served as the evaluation endpoint (Dice Similarity Coefficient). In single reader training, SwinUNETR achieved an average dice score of 0.816 for Reader#1 and 0.860 for Reader#2, while UNETR scored 0.8 and 0.833 for Readers #1 and #2, respectively, compared to the baseline UNets 0.825 for Reader #1 and 0.851 for Reader #2. SwinUNETR had an average dice score of 0.8583 for Reader#1 and 0.867 for Reader#2 in cross-validated mixed training. For the gland size-based dataset, SwinUNETR achieved an average dice score of 0.902 for Reader#1 subset and 0.894 for Reader#2, using the five-fold mixed training strategy (Reader#1, n=53; Reader#2, n=87) at larger gland size-based subsets, where UNETR performed poorly. Our findings demonstrate that global and shifted-window self-attention effectively reduces label noise and class imbalance sensitivity, resulting in improvements in the Dice score over CNNs by up to five points while maintaining computational efficiency.

In this work, we employ GemNet-T, a graph neural network model, as an MLFF and investigate two training strategies: (1) direct training on MD17 (10K samples) without pre-training, and (2) pre-training on the large-scale OC20 dataset followed by fine-tuning on MD17 (10K). While both approaches achieve low force mean absolute errors (MAEs), reaching 5 meV/A per atom, we find that lower force errors do not necessarily guarantee stable MD simulations. Notably, the pre-trained GemNet-T model yields significantly improved simulation stability, sustaining trajectories up to three times longer than the model trained from scratch.

Unlike traditional AI teaching based on unilateral knowledge transfer, this addresses the challenge of integrating information from inherently different modalities. We empirically test this framework using a human-AI interaction model based on the Metropolis-Hastings naming game (MHNG), a decentralized Bayesian inference mechanism. In an online experiment, 69 participants played a joint attention naming game (JA-NG) with one of three computer agent types (MH-based, always-accept, or always-reject) under partial observability. Results show that human-AI pairs with an MH-based agent significantly improved categorization accuracy through interaction and achieved stronger convergence toward a shared sign system.

DisProtEdit aligns protein and text embeddings using alignment and uniformity objectives, while a disentanglement loss promotes independence between structural and functional semantics. At inference time, protein editing is performed by modifying one or both text inputs and decoding from the updated latent representation. Experiments on protein editing and representation learning benchmarks demonstrate that DisProtEdit performs competitively with existing methods while providing improved interpretability and controllability.

In our study, we introduce GenHOI, a novel two-stage framework aimed at achieving two key objectives: 1) generalization to unseen objects and 2) the synthesis of high-fidelity 4D HOI sequences. In the initial stage of our framework, we employ an Object-AnchorNet to reconstruct sparse 3D HOI keyframes for unseen objects, learning solely from 3D HOI datasets, thereby mitigating the dependence on large-scale 4D HOI datasets. Subsequently, we introduce a Contact-Aware Diffusion Model (ContactDM) in the second stage to seamlessly interpolate sparse 3D HOI keyframes into densely temporally coherent 4D HOI sequences. To enhance the quality of generated 4D HOI sequences, we propose a novel Contact-Aware Encoder within ContactDM to extract human-object contact patterns and a novel Contact-Aware HOI Attention to effectively integrate the contact signals into diffusion models.

The severe constraints of NISQ hardware, particularly in circuit depth and connectivity, hinder both the validation of quantum advantage and the empirical investigation of major obstacles like barren plateaus. Circuit cutting techniques have emerged as a strategy to execute larger quantum circuits on smaller, less connected hardware by dividing them into subcircuits. However, this partitioning increases the number of samples needed to estimate the expectation value accurately through classical post-processing compared to estimating it directly from the full circuit. This work introduces a novel regularization term into the QML optimization process, directly penalizing the overhead associated with sampling. We demonstrate that this approach enables the optimizer to balance the advantages of gate cutting against the optimization of the typical ML cost function. Specifically, it navigates the trade-off between minimizing the cutting overhead and maintaining the overall accuracy of the QML model, paving the way to study larger complex problems in pursuit of quantum advantage.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u9879\uff0c\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u4f18\u5316\u4e2d\u5e73\u8861\u4e86\u95e8\u5207\u5272\u7684\u91c7\u6837\u5f00\u9500\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u91cf\u5b50\u7535\u8def\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u91cf\u5b50\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5728NISQ\u786c\u4ef6\u4e0a\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u5e76\u89e3\u51b3\u56e0\u7535\u8def\u6df1\u5ea6\u548c\u8fde\u63a5\u6027\u9650\u5236\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5982\u8d2b\u7620\u9ad8\u539f\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5728QML\u4f18\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u9879\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u60e9\u7f5a\u4e0e\u91c7\u6837\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u4ee5\u5e73\u8861\u95e8\u5207\u5272\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edfML\u6210\u672c\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u4f18\u5316\u91c7\u6837\u5f00\u9500\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u590d\u6742\u95ee\u9898\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u91cf\u5b50\u4f18\u52bf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9014\u5f84\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u9879\u5728QML\u4f18\u5316\u4e2d\u7684\u521b\u65b0\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3NISQ\u786c\u4ef6\u9650\u5236\u4e0b\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u4f18\u52bf\u63a2\u7d22\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "keywords": "\u91cf\u5b50\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60, NISQ\u786c\u4ef6, \u7535\u8def\u5207\u5272, \u6b63\u5219\u5316, \u91cf\u5b50\u4f18\u52bf"}}

OS-Harm is built on top of the OSWorld environment and aims to test models across three categories of harm: deliberate user misuse, prompt injection attacks, and model misbehavior. To cover these cases, we create 150 tasks that span several types of safety violations (harassment, copyright infringement, disinformation, data exfiltration, etc.) and require the agent to interact with a variety of OS applications (email client, code editor, browser, etc.). Moreover, we propose an automated judge to evaluate both accuracy and safety of agents that achieves high agreement with human annotations (0.76 and 0.79 F1 score). We evaluate computer use agents based on a range of frontier models - such as o4-mini, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Pro - and provide insights into their safety.

This assumption requires the conditional class probability function of the data distribution to be the composition of $q+1$ vector-valued multivariate functions, where each component function is either a maximum value function or a H\u00f6lder-$\u03b2$ smooth function that depends only on $d_*$ of its input variables. Notably, $d_*$ can be significantly smaller than the input dimension $d$. We prove that, under these conditions, the optimal convergence rate for the excess 0-1 risk of classifiers is $$ \\left( \\frac{1}{n} \\right)^{\\frac{\u03b2\\cdot(1\\wedge\u03b2)^q}{{\\frac{d_*}{s+1}+(1+\\frac{1}{s+1})\\cdot\u03b2\\cdot(1\\wedge\u03b2)^q}}}\\;\\;\\;, $$ which is independent of the input dimension $d$. Additionally, we demonstrate that ReLU deep neural networks (DNNs) trained with hinge loss can achieve this optimal convergence rate up to a logarithmic factor. This result provides theoretical justification for the excellent performance of ReLU DNNs in practical classification tasks, particularly in high-dimensional settings. The technique used to establish these results extends the oracle inequality presented in our previous work.

Although membership inference attacks and hidden canaries have been explored to trace data usage, such methods rely on memorization of training data, which LM providers try to limit. In this work, we demonstrate that indirect data poisoning (where the targeted behavior is absent from training data) is not only feasible but also allow to effectively protect a dataset and trace its use. Using gradient-based optimization prompt-tuning, we make a model learn arbitrary secret sequences: secret responses to secret prompts that are absent from the training corpus. We validate our approach on language models pre-trained from scratch and show that less than 0.005% of poisoned tokens are sufficient to covertly make a LM learn a secret and detect it with extremely high confidence ($p < 10^{-55}$) with a theoretically certifiable scheme.

Membership Inference Attack (MIA) has emerged as a potential approach to determine if a specific image was used to train a diffusion model, thus quantifying privacy risks. Existing MIA methods often rely on diffusion reconstruction errors, where member images are expected to have lower reconstruction errors than non-member images. However, applying these methods directly to medical images faces challenges. Reconstruction error is influenced by inherent image difficulty, and diffusion models struggle with high-frequency detail reconstruction. To address these issues, we propose a Frequency-Calibrated Reconstruction Error (FCRE) method for MIAs on medical image diffusion models. By focusing on reconstruction errors within a specific mid-frequency range and excluding both high-frequency (difficult to reconstruct) and low-frequency (less informative) regions, our frequency-selective approach mitigates the confounding factor of inherent image difficulty. Specifically, we analyze the reverse diffusion process, obtain the mid-frequency reconstruction error, and compute the structural similarity index score between the reconstructed and original images. Membership is determined by comparing this score to a threshold. Experiments on several medical image datasets demonstrate that our FCRE method outperforms existing MIA methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9891\u7387\u6821\u51c6\u91cd\u5efa\u8bef\u5dee\uff08FCRE\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9009\u62e9\u4e2d\u9891\u533a\u57df\u7684\u8bef\u5dee\u6765\u6539\u8fdb\u6210\u5458\u63a8\u7406\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9ad8\u9891\u548c\u4f4e\u9891\u533a\u57df\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u7b49\u654f\u611f\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u5f15\u53d1\u9690\u79c1\u62c5\u5fe7\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u6210\u5458\u63a8\u7406\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u91cd\u5efa\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u9700\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faFCRE\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u53cd\u5411\u6269\u6563\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e2d\u9891\u533a\u57df\u91cd\u5efa\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7ed3\u6784\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u6307\u6570\u8bc4\u5206\uff0c\u8bbe\u5b9a\u9608\u503c\u5224\u65ad\u6210\u5458\u8eab\u4efd\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cFCRE\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6210\u5458\u63a8\u7406\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "FCRE\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u9891\u7387\u9009\u62e9\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u91cd\u5efa\u8bef\u5dee\u53d7\u56fe\u50cf\u56fa\u6709\u96be\u5ea6\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6210\u5458\u63a8\u7406\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "keywords": "\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u6210\u5458\u63a8\u7406\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u9891\u7387\u6821\u51c6\uff0c\u91cd\u5efa\u8bef\u5dee"}}

Theoretical evidence for invariance of the self-attention mechanism to softmax activation is obtained by appealing to paradifferential calculus, (and is supported by computational examples), which relies on the intrinsic organization of the attention heads. Furthermore, we use an existing methodology for hierarchical organization of tensors to examine network structure by constructing hierarchal partition trees with respect to the query, key, and head axes of network 3-tensors. Such an organization is consequential since it allows one to profitably execute common signal processing tasks on a geometry where the organized network 3-tensors exhibit regularity. We exemplify this qualitatively, by visualizing the hierarchical organization of the tree comprised of attention heads and the diffusion map embeddings, and quantitatively by investigating network sparsity with the expansion coefficients of individual attention heads and the entire network with respect to the bi and tri-haar bases (respectively) on the space of queries, keys, and heads of the network. To showcase the utility of our theoretical and methodological findings, we provide computational examples using vision and language transformers. The ramifications of these findings are two-fold: (1) a subsequent step in interpretability analysis is theoretically admitted, and can be exploited empirically for downstream interpretability tasks (2) one can use the network 3-tensor organization for empirical network applications such as model pruning (by virtue of network sparsity) and network architecture comparison.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86Transformer\u4e2d\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u7684\u5185\u5728\uff08\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\u5185\uff09\u548c\u5916\u5728\uff08\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\u95f4\uff09\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u793a\u4f8b\u652f\u6301\u5176\u5bf9\u4e8esoftmax\u6fc0\u6d3b\u7684\u4e0d\u53ef\u53d8\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u5206\u5c42\u5f20\u91cf\u7ec4\u7ec7\u65b9\u6cd5\u5206\u6790\u7f51\u7edc\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u8bed\u8a00Transformer\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u52a8\u673a\u5728\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u7684\u56fa\u6709\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u7ec4\u7ec7\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u5bf9\u5176\u5728Transformer\u4e2d\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u8ba4\u8bc6\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u65b9\u6cd5\u5305\u62ec\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\uff08\u5229\u7528\u51c6\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\uff09\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff08\u6784\u5efa\u5206\u5c42\u5206\u533a\u6811\u53ca\u6269\u6563\u6620\u5c04\u5d4c\u5165\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u548c\u57fa\u5c55\u5f00\u7cfb\u6570\u8fdb\u884c\u91cf\u5316\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u5bf9softmax\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5177\u6709\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7f51\u7edc\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u6a21\u578b\u526a\u679d\u548c\u67b6\u6784\u6bd4\u8f83\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u8bba\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53d1\u73b0\u4e3a\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u5206\u6790\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u4f18\u5316\uff08\u5982\u526a\u679d\uff09\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "keywords": "\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0cTransformer\uff0c\u51c6\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\uff0c\u7f51\u7edc\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u526a\u679d"}}

Each prompt-rubric pair has a corresponding benign version to test for model over-refusals. This evaluation of frontier LLMs' safeguard robustness reveals varying trade-offs between potential risks and model usefulness: Claude-3.5-Sonnet demonstrates a low average risk score (ARS) (14.09 out of 100) but the highest over-refusal score (ORS) (21.8 out of 100), while Gemini 2.5 Pro shows low over-refusal (1.4) but a high average potential risk (66.29).

Vibration-based structural health monitoring offers a valuable approach to assessing structural integrity and understanding the structural implications of these impacts.

This study investigates the application of the Gaussian Process Latent Force Model (GPLFM) for virtual sensing on the Magerholm ferry quay, combining in-operation experimental data collected during a ferry impact with a detailed physics-based model. The proposed Physics-Encoded Machine Learning model integrates a reduced-order structural model with a data-driven GPLFM representing the unknown impact forces via their modal contributions. Significant challenges are addressed for the development of the Digital Twin of the ferry quay, including unknown impact characteristics (location, direction, intensity), time-varying boundary conditions, and sparse sensor configurations. Results show that the GPLFM provides accurate acceleration response estimates at most locations, even under simplifying modeling assumptions such as linear time-invariant behavior during the impact phase. Lower accuracy was observed at locations in the impact zone. A numerical study was conducted to explore an optimal real-world sensor placement strategy using a Backward Sequential Sensor Placement approach. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to examine the influence of sensor types, sampling frequencies, and incorrectly assumed damping ratios.

Specifically, many techniques for causal inference, such as instrumental variable (IV) regression and proximal causal learning (PCL), are CMR problems. Most CMR estimators use a two-stage approach, where the first-stage estimation is directly plugged into the second stage to estimate the function of interest. However, naively plugging in the first-stage estimator can cause heavy bias in the second stage. This is particularly the case for recently proposed CMR estimators that use deep neural network (DNN) estimators for both stages, where regularisation and overfitting bias is present. We propose DML-CMR, a two-stage CMR estimator that provides an unbiased estimate with fast convergence rate guarantees. We derive a novel learning objective to reduce bias and develop the DML-CMR algorithm following the double/debiased machine learning (DML) framework. We show that our DML-CMR estimator can achieve the minimax optimal convergence rate of $O(N^{-1/2})$ under parameterisation and mild regularity conditions, where $N$ is the sample size.

Existing SD-based Real-VSR methods often compromise spatial details for temporal coherence, resulting in suboptimal visual quality. We argue that the key lies in how to effectively extract the degradation-robust temporal consistency priors from the low-quality (LQ) input video and enhance the video details while maintaining the extracted consistency priors. To achieve this, we propose a Dual LoRA Learning (DLoRAL) paradigm to train an effective SD-based one-step diffusion model, achieving realistic frame details and temporal consistency simultaneously. Specifically, we introduce a Cross-Frame Retrieval (CFR) module to aggregate complementary information across frames, and train a Consistency-LoRA (C-LoRA) to learn robust temporal representations from degraded inputs. After consistency learning, we fix the CFR and C-LoRA modules and train a Detail-LoRA (D-LoRA) to enhance spatial details while aligning with the temporal space defined by C-LoRA to keep temporal coherence. The two phases alternate iteratively for optimization, collaboratively delivering consistent and detail-rich outputs.

Trained across five calcium imaging datasets spanning zebrafish, mice, and C. elegans, POCO achieves state-of-the-art accuracy at cellular resolution in spontaneous behaviors. After pre-training, POCO rapidly adapts to new recordings with minimal fine-tuning. Notably, POCO's learned unit embeddings recover biologically meaningful structure-such as brain region clustering-without any anatomical labels. Our comprehensive analysis reveals several key factors influencing performance, including context length, session diversity, and preprocessing. Together, these results position POCO as a scalable and adaptable approach for cross-session neural forecasting and offer actionable insights for future model design.

Deep Learning (DL) has recently emerged as a powerful tool for extracting meaningful patterns from medical data to aid in diagnosis. However, existing DL approaches struggle to effectively leverage multi-modal MRI and clinical data, leading to suboptimal performance.\n  To address this challenge, we utilize a unique, proprietary multi-modal clinical dataset curated for ND research. Based on this dataset, we propose a novel transformer-based Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework for ND classification, leveraging multiple MRI modalities-anatomical (aMRI), Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI), and functional (fMRI)-alongside clinical assessments. Our framework employs transformer encoders to capture spatial relationships within volumetric MRI data while utilizing modality-specific experts for targeted feature extraction. A gating mechanism with adaptive fusion dynamically integrates expert outputs, ensuring optimal predictive performance. Comprehensive experiments and comparisons with multiple baselines demonstrate that our multi-modal approach significantly enhances diagnostic accuracy, particularly in distinguishing overlapping disease states.

In the realm of neuromorphic computing, although spiking neural networks (SNNs) aim to emulate biology more closely than traditional artificial neural networks do, synaptic delays are rarely incorporated into their simulation. We introduce a novel learning rule for simultaneously learning synaptic connection strengths and delays, by extending spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP), a Hebbian method commonly used for learning synaptic weights. We validate our approach by extending a widely-used SNN model for classification trained with unsupervised learning.

While prior research has introduced various deep learning models for this purpose, many struggle to balance noise suppression, perceptual quality, and speaker-specific feature preservation, leaving a critical research gap in their comparative performance evaluation. This study benchmarks three state-of-the-art models Wave-U-Net, CMGAN, and U-Net, on diverse datasets such as SpEAR, VPQAD, and Clarkson datasets. These models were chosen due to their relevance in the literature and code accessibility. The evaluation reveals that U-Net achieves high noise suppression with SNR improvements of +71.96% on SpEAR, +64.83% on VPQAD, and +364.2% on the Clarkson dataset. CMGAN outperforms in perceptual quality, attaining the highest PESQ scores of 4.04 on SpEAR and 1.46 on VPQAD, making it well-suited for applications prioritizing natural and intelligible speech. Wave-U-Net balances these attributes with improvements in speaker-specific feature retention, evidenced by VeriSpeak score gains of +10.84% on SpEAR and +27.38% on VPQAD.

Does higher perceptual quality of images already translate to better MLLM understanding? We conduct the first systematic study spanning leading MLLMs and a suite of vision-language benchmarks, applying controlled degradations and stylistic shifts to each image. Surprisingly, we uncover a visual-quality paradox: model, task, and even individual-instance performance can improve when images deviate from human-perceived fidelity. Off-the-shelf restoration pipelines fail to reconcile these idiosyncratic preferences. To close the gap, we introduce Visual-Quality Test-Time Tuning (VQ-TTT)-a lightweight adaptation module that: (1) inserts a learnable, low-rank kernel before the frozen vision encoder to modulate frequency content; and (2) fine-tunes only shallow vision-encoder layers via LoRA. VQ-TTT dynamically adjusts each input image in a single forward pass, aligning it with task-specific model preferences. Across the evaluated MLLMs and all datasets, VQ-TTT lifts significant average accuracy, with no external models, cached features, or extra training data.

Current state-of-the-art algorithms based on optimal instantiations of the matrix mechanism cannot be directly applied here because their privacy guarantees only hold when key parameters are tuned to $n$. Using the common `doubling trick' avoids knowledge of $n$ but leads to suboptimal and non-smooth error. We solve this problem by introducing novel matrix factorizations based on logarithmic perturbations of the function $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-z}}$ studied in prior works, which may be of independent interest. The resulting algorithm has smooth error, and for any $\u03b1> 0$ and $t\\leq n$ it is able to privately estimate the sum of the first $t$ data points with $O(\\log^{2+2\u03b1}(t))$ variance. It requires $O(t)$ space and amortized $O(\\log t)$ time per round, compared to $O(\\log(n)\\log(t))$ variance, $O(n)$ space and $O(n \\log n)$ pre-processing time for the nearly-optimal bounded-input algorithm of Henzinger et al. (SODA 2023). Empirically, we find that our algorithm's performance is also comparable to theirs in absolute terms: our variance is less than $1.5\\times$ theirs for $t$ as large as $2^{24}$.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u65e0\u8fb9\u754c\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u6301\u7eed\u8ba1\u6570\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5bf9\u6570\u6270\u52a8\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u77e9\u9635\u5206\u89e3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5e73\u6ed1\u8bef\u5dee\u548c\u8f83\u4f4e\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0e\u7a7a\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u65e0\u8fb9\u754c\u8f93\u5165\u4e0b\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u6301\u7eed\u8ba1\u6570\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u9884\u77e5\u8f93\u5165\u89c4\u6a21\u4e14\u8bef\u5dee\u4e0d\u7406\u60f3\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u5bf9\u6570\u6270\u52a8\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u77e9\u9635\u5206\u89e3\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u514b\u670d\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u8bef\u5dee\u5e73\u6ed1\u4e14\u65b9\u5dee\u8f83\u4f4e\uff0c\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\u5177\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u65b0\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u65e0\u8fb9\u754c\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u5b9e\u7528\uff0c\u4e3a\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u6301\u7eed\u8ba1\u6570\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "keywords": "\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1, \u6301\u7eed\u8ba1\u6570, \u77e9\u9635\u5206\u89e3, \u5bf9\u6570\u6270\u52a8, \u65e0\u8fb9\u754c\u8f93\u5165"}}

However, this advancement also introduces serious cybersecurity risks due to the use of complex and often opaque models, extensive interconnectivity, interoperability with third-party peripheral devices, Internet connectivity, and vulnerabilities in the underlying technologies. These factors contribute to a broad attack surface and make threat prevention, detection, and mitigation challenging. Given the highly safety-critical nature of these devices, a cyberattack on these devices can cause the ML models to mispredict, thereby posing significant safety risks to patients. Therefore, ensuring the security of these devices from the time of design is essential. This paper underscores the urgency of addressing the cybersecurity challenges in ML-enabled medical devices at the pre-market phase.

A Convolutional Autoencoder (CAE) is exploited to implement a jamming detection over various characteristics such as heterogenous I/Q datasets; extracting relevant information on Synchronization Signal Blocks (SSBs), and fewer SSB observations with notable class imbalance. Given the characteristics of datasets, balanced datasets are acquired by employing a Conv1D conditional Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network-Gradient Penalty(CWGAN-GP) on both majority and minority SSB observations. Additionally, we compare the performance and detection ability of the proposed CAE model on augmented datasets with benchmark models: Convolutional Denoising Autoencoder (CDAE) and Convolutional Sparse Autoencoder (CSAE).

Two critical issues in existing vector quantization methods are training instability and codebook collapse. Training instability arises from the gradient discrepancy introduced by the straight-through estimator, especially in the presence of significant quantization errors, while codebook collapse occurs when only a small subset of code vectors are utilized during training. A closer examination of these issues reveals that they are primarily driven by a mismatch between the distributions of the features and code vectors, leading to unrepresentative code vectors and significant data information loss during compression. To address this, we employ the Wasserstein distance to align these two distributions, achieving near 100\\% codebook utilization and significantly reducing the quantization error.

However, in complex environments, the number of objects to potentially interact with is vast, and their physical properties are often uncertain. This complexity makes it infeasible to employ a single global model. Therefore, we need to resort to online system identification of context-aware models that capture only the currently relevant aspects of the environment. While physical principles such as the conservation of energy may not hold across varying contexts, ensuring physical plausibility for any individual context-aware model can still be highly desirable, particularly when using it for receding horizon control methods such as Model Predictive Control (MPC). Hence, in this work, we extend DeLaN to make it context-aware, combine it with a recurrent network for online system identification, and integrate it with a MPC for adaptive, physics-informed control.

Minimizing these vibrations is crucial for improving passenger comfort. This work presents a novel design optimization approach based on guided flow matching for reducing vibrations by placing beadings (indentations) in plate-like structures. Our method integrates a generative flow matching model and a surrogate model trained to predict structural vibrations. During the generation process, the flow matching model pushes towards manufacturability while the surrogate model pushes to low-vibration solutions. The flow matching model and its training data implicitly define the design space, enabling a broader exploration of potential solutions as no optimization of manually-defined design parameters is required. We apply our method to a range of differentiable optimization objectives, including direct optimization of specific eigenfrequencies through careful construction of the objective function. Results demonstrate that our method generates diverse and manufacturable plate designs with reduced structural vibrations compared to designs from random search, a criterion-based design heuristic and genetic optimization.

To this end, we investigate sorted nonsmooth penalties as a regularization approach for generalized linear models. We focus on a family of sorted nonconvex penalties which generalizes the Sorted L1 Norm (SLOPE). These penalties are designed to promote clustering of variables due to their sorted nature, while the nonconvexity reduces the shrinkage of coefficients. Our goal is to provide efficient ways to compute their proximal operator, enabling the use of popular proximal algorithms to solve composite optimization problems with this choice of sorted penalties. We distinguish between two classes of problems: the weakly convex case where computing the proximal operator remains a convex problem, and the nonconvex case where computing the proximal operator becomes a challenging nonconvex combinatorial problem. For the weakly convex case (e.g. sorted MCP and SCAD), we explain how the Pool Adjacent Violators (PAV) algorithm can exactly compute the proximal operator. For the nonconvex case (e.g. sorted Lq with q in ]0,1[), we show that a slight modification of this algorithm turns out to be remarkably efficient to tackle the computation of the proximal operator. We also present new theoretical insights on the minimizers of the nonconvex proximal problem.

A crucial yet overlooked phenomenon is that recourse explanations are performative: When many applicants act according to their recommendations, their collective behavior may change statistical regularities in the data and, once the model is refitted, also the decision boundary. Consequently, the recourse algorithm may render its own recommendations invalid, such that applicants who make the effort of implementing their recommendations may be rejected again when they reapply. In this work, we formally characterize the conditions under which recourse explanations remain valid under performativity. A key finding is that recourse actions may become invalid if they are influenced by or if they intervene on non-causal variables.

Our MT-GS and AMT-GS can take advantage of similarities between (local) objectives to reduce the communication rounds, are flexible so that different subsets (of agents) can communicate at different, user-picked rates, and are fully deterministic. These three desirable features are achieved through a block-decomposable primal-dual formulation, and a multi-timescale variant of the sliding method introduced in Lan et al.

Here, $\\overline{r}$ measures the ``average rate of updates'' for dual blocks, and $A$ measures similarities between (subgradients of) local functions. In addition, the linear dependency of communication rounds on $A$ is optimal (Arjevani and Shamir 2015), thereby providing a positive answer to the open question whether such dependency is achievable for non-smooth objectives (Arjevani and Shamir 2015).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u51f8\u975e\u5149\u6ed1\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u4e00\u9636\u65b9\u6cd5MT-GS\u548cAMT-GS\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u65f6\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\u68af\u5ea6\u6ed1\u52a8\u51cf\u5c11\u901a\u4fe1\u8f6e\u6570\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0d\u540c\u4ee3\u7406\u4ee5\u4e0d\u540c\u901f\u7387\u901a\u4fe1\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u4f18\u5316\u4e2d\u901a\u4fe1\u8f6e\u6570\u8fc7\u591a\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u9002\u5e94\u4e0d\u540c\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u901a\u4fe1\u901f\u7387\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5757\u53ef\u5206\u89e3\u7684\u539f\u59cb\u5bf9\u5076\u5f62\u5f0f\u548c\u591a\u65f6\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\u6ed1\u52a8\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u5bf9\u5076\u5757\u4ee5\u4e0d\u540c\u901f\u7387\u66f4\u65b0\u3002", "result": "MT-GS\u548cAMT-GS\u5728Lipchitz\u76ee\u6807\u4e0b\u5206\u522b\u9700\u8981O(\\overline{r}A/\u03b5)\u548cO(\\overline{r}A/\u221a(\u03b5\u03bc))\u901a\u4fe1\u8f6e\u6570\uff0c\u5b50\u68af\u5ea6\u6b65\u6570\u5206\u522b\u4e3aO(\\overline{r}/\u03b5\u00b2)\u548cO(\\overline{r}/(\u03b5\u03bc))\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u6700\u4f18\u4f9d\u8d56\u03b5\u548c\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027A\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u4e3a\u975e\u5149\u6ed1\u76ee\u6807\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u4f18\u5316\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "keywords": "\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u4f18\u5316, \u591a\u65f6\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\u68af\u5ea6\u6ed1\u52a8, \u901a\u4fe1\u6548\u7387, \u975e\u5149\u6ed1\u4f18\u5316"}}

The capacity to separate out-of-distribution (OOD) samples has proven to be a valuable indicator of a model's reliability in research. In medical imaging, this is especially critical, as identifying OOD inputs can help flag potential anomalies that might otherwise go undetected. While many OOD detection methods rely on feature or logit space representations, recent works suggest these approaches may not fully capture OOD diversity. To address this, we propose a novel OOD scoring mechanism, called NERO, that leverages neuron-level relevance at the feature layer. Specifically, we cluster neuron-level relevance for each in-distribution (ID) class to form representative centroids and introduce a relevance distance metric to quantify a new sample's deviation from these centroids, enhancing OOD separability. Additionally, we refine performance by incorporating scaled relevance in the bias term and combining feature norms. Our framework also enables explainable OOD detection.

The inevitable challenge here is the churn of nodes due to failures and the operator's scheduling policies, leading to losing a stage - a part of the model. The conventional approaches to recover from failures are to either use checkpointing, where periodically a copy of the entire model is sent to an additional storage, or redundant computation. These approaches yield significant communication and/or computation overhead even in non-failure cases and scale poorly in settings with large models. In this paper, we propose, CheckFree, an efficient recovery method where a failing stage is substituted by a weighted average of the closest neighboring stages. In contrast to the state of the art, CheckFree requires no additional computation or storage. However, because of the nature of averaging neighbouring stages, it can only recover failures of intermediate stages. We further extend our method to CheckFree+ with out-of-order pipeline execution to tolerate crashes of the first and last stages. Thanks to out-of-order pipelining, behaviour of those stages is mimicked by their neighboring ones, which allows CheckFree+ to recover them by simply copying the weights from the immediate neighbour. To be able to recover the (de)embedding layers, CheckFree+ copies those layers to the neighboring stages, which requires relatively small storage overhead. We extensively evaluate our method on LLaMa models of model sizes from 124M to 1.5B with varying failure frequencies. In the case of low and medium failure rates (5-10%), CheckFree and CheckFree+ outperform both checkpointing and redundant computation in terms of convergence in wall-clock time by over 12%.

Our method uses a novel time-dependent binary classifier trained using a contrastive estimation-based objective that trains the classifier to discriminate between realizations of the stochastic process at two nearby time instants. Significantly, the proposed method explicitly models the time-dependent probability distribution, which means that it is possible to obtain the value of the probability density within the time horizon of interest. Additionally, the input before the final activation in the time-dependent classifier is a second-order approximation to the partial derivative, with respect to time, of the logarithm of the density. We apply the proposed approach to approximate the time-dependent probability density functions for systems driven by stochastic excitations. We also use the proposed approach to synthesize new samples of a random vector from a given set of its realizations. In such applications, we generate sample paths necessary for training using stochastic interpolants. Subsequently, new samples are generated using gradient-based Markov chain Monte Carlo methods because automatic differentiation can efficiently provide the necessary gradient. Further, we demonstrate the utility of an explicit approximation to the time-dependent probability density function through applications in unsupervised outlier detection.

We design a novel implementation based on dynamic programming that greatly improves its computational efficiency. Furthermore, we show via careful numerical experiments that our method can outperform popular methods such as lasso and elastic net across a wide range of settings.

We prove this fact rigorously in the setting of orthogonal features, in which case, the ensemble estimator rescales the ordinary least squares coefficients with a two-parameter family of logistic weights, thereby enlarging the model search space.

We introduce \\textbf{Value-guided Inference with Margin-based Reward (ViMaR)}, a two-stage inference framework that improves both efficiency and output fidelity by combining a temporal-difference value model with a margin-aware reward adjustment. In the first stage, we perform a single pass to identify the highest-value caption among diverse candidates. In the second stage, we selectively refine only those segments that were overlooked or exhibit weak visual grounding, thereby eliminating frequently rewarded evaluations. A calibrated margin-based penalty discourages low-confidence continuations while preserving descriptive richness. Extensive experiments across multiple VLM architectures demonstrate that ViMaR generates captions that are significantly more reliable, factually accurate, detailed, and explanatory, while achieving over 4$\\times$ speedup compared to existing value-guided methods. Specifically, we show that ViMaR trained solely on LLaVA Mistral-7B, \\textit{generalizes effectively to guide decoding in a stronger unseen model}. To further validate this, we adapt the ViMaR to steer generation in LLaVA-OneVision-Qwen2-7B, leading to consistent improvements in caption quality and demonstrating robust cross-model guidance. This cross-model generalization highlights ViMaR's flexibility and modularity, positioning it as a scalable and transferable inference-time decoding strategy.

In the second step, these datasets, along with the memory-dependent property of fractional-order systems, are used to estimate the system's fractional order. The drift and control vector fields are then reconstructed using orthonormal basis functions. To validate the proposed approach, the algorithm is applied to four benchmark fractional-order systems.

We address these challenges with a neural dynamics framework that combines object particles and spatial grids in a hybrid representation. Our particle-grid model captures global shape and motion information while predicting dense particle movements, enabling the modeling of objects with varied shapes and materials. Particles represent object shapes, while the spatial grid discretizes the 3D space to ensure spatial continuity and enhance learning efficiency. Coupled with Gaussian Splattings for visual rendering, our framework achieves a fully learning-based digital twin of deformable objects and generates 3D action-conditioned videos. Through experiments, we demonstrate that our model learns the dynamics of diverse objects -- such as ropes, cloths, stuffed animals, and paper bags -- from sparse-view RGB-D recordings of robot-object interactions, while also generalizing at the category level to unseen instances. Our approach outperforms state-of-the-art learning-based and physics-based simulators, particularly in scenarios with limited camera views.

Although state-of-the-art generative models, such as diffusion models, have made significant progress in 3D generation, they often fall short of human-designed content due to limited ability to follow instructions, align with human preferences, or produce realistic textures, geometries, and physical attributes. In this paper, we introduce Nabla-R2D3, a highly effective and sample-efficient reinforcement learning alignment framework for 3D-native diffusion models using 2D rewards. Built upon the recently proposed Nabla-GFlowNet method, which matches the score function to reward gradients in a principled manner for reward finetuning, our Nabla-R2D3 enables effective adaptation of 3D diffusion models using only 2D reward signals. Extensive experiments show that, unlike vanilla finetuning baselines which either struggle to converge or suffer from reward hacking, Nabla-R2D3 consistently achieves higher rewards and reduced prior forgetting within a few finetuning steps.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aNabla-R2D3\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5bf9\u9f50\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4f18\u53163D\u539f\u751f\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ec5\u4f7f\u75282D\u5956\u52b1\u4fe1\u53f7\u5373\u53ef\u751f\u6210\u66f4\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u903c\u771f\u76843D\u5185\u5bb9\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d3D\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff09\u5728\u751f\u62103D\u8d44\u4ea7\u65f6\u4ecd\u96be\u4ee5\u8fbe\u5230\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u5185\u5bb9\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u9075\u5faa\u6307\u4ee4\u3001\u7b26\u5408\u4eba\u7c7b\u504f\u597d\u6216\u751f\u6210\u903c\u771f\u7eb9\u7406\u3001\u51e0\u4f55\u53ca\u7269\u7406\u5c5e\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8eNabla-GFlowNet\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0cNabla-R2D3\u5728\u5956\u52b1\u5fae\u8c03\u4e2d\u4ee5\u539f\u5219\u6027\u65b9\u5f0f\u5339\u914d\u5956\u52b1\u68af\u5ea6\u7684\u5f97\u5206\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf93D\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u8c03\u6574\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cNabla-R2D3\u5728\u8f83\u5c11\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u6b65\u9aa4\u5185\u80fd\u7a33\u5b9a\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u9ad8\u5956\u52b1\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u5148\u9a8c\u9057\u5fd8\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "Nabla-R2D3\u4e3a3D\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u6837\u672c\u5229\u7528\u7387\u9ad8\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "keywords": "3D\u751f\u6210, \u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b, \u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60, \u5956\u52b1\u4fe1\u53f7, Nabla-R2D3"}}
